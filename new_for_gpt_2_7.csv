receipt. he kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. however, it clearly had mrp mentioned on it2. i went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just inr200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. he just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws which i had bought with him. after about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. and for all this, he kept cussing me that i wasted his time. there was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.this whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. this was the worst installation experience in my life so far.bottomline please do not avail the so called free installation service from amazon. it is just a scam. instead call the acer support. they will do the job much better.,after using it for 2 months, here are its pros and conspros 1. great picture quality. its awesome.2. blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. sound with 30db is very good4. looks great with thin besel5. remote comes with favorite ott buttons.6. content upscaling is very good.cons1. remote could have been better. cant use dth remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. remote operation is bit complex.3. motion technology not great. there is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson ott, but it decreases when you switch to dth.overall, its a nice buy at this price point. i think i am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. i am satisfied with the product.,product has good picture quality. good product at that price with 25w sound. applications running smoothly. 3 months older no issues yet. its running smoothly.,you get decent features for the price you pay. screen resolution might be. set back as you may find pixalation. overall its good,i am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p hd ready tv. it is truly an amazing panel. i found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. the speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. however, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the tv is wall mounted or kept on a stand.the remote is good, voice search works well for me. tv start up takes a long time in my opinion, but i have not compared it against any other 32 inch tv and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 ghz wifi works very well even across walls. only negative aspect i faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphonesearphones. firstly, the connection sometimes doesnt happen automatically after a restart which means i have to remove and rediscover the device thru the menu which is not simple. secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the tv, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 23 inches.however, i am still super happy with this tv. i got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,at this price range11499it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is goodsometimes lagging.no major issues found on this tv.just go for it.,vellu for money. good product,very nice productsave money <|>"

the quality of sound. dolby audio 20w speakers are really great for sure affordable tv.2. size and slim it is slim and looks stylish. very light weight and handy to install.3. easy to install and

sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. it supports all the smart features like netflix, prime and youtube. it is easily installable and signin to start using quickly.8. it is also easy to scan the setup box channels and start viewing them.cons1. picture quality is 776p. its average and not very clear. but it is worth the price range. ill not complaint as the cost of tv is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. bluetooth and wifi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. i encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.rest all is very good and loved this product. i feel it was worth ordering. if you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and dont have extensive smart use then 100 go for this.if you want to use a lot of smart features and ott platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full hd and 4k quality. this tv will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but its very good for daily family shows and tv channels.one last thing i want to express and im ver disappointed about is this.i got my order delivered on friday and i scheduled my installation for saturday. but nobody turned up that day and i had to reschedule it for tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. i got a call from amazon to reschedule it for tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.this is very very bad and irresponsible service by oneplus and amazon. im very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. a company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.what do you guys expect us to do wait for 5 to 6 days to get my tv installed even when its been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. even when im having my smart tv delivered to my home, i have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.at least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. you should take care that the money i spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. highly disappointed with this behavior and service.,good product,connectivity is faster,but performance is little bit slower,,the biggest problem i face is it dont have a aux cable so im not able to connect my sound bar......the hdmi port is useless it wont work .so,i connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it wont connect automatically, everytime i on the tv i need to connect it manually its a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now its been 4 months and its super laggy .....even after the update its just the same.....yeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstanding......thats all,good quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice. budget friendly, im happy with this .,after a few days, the tv will perform slowly and the remote is very very sentence,thank you amazon and oneplus,1. sound is good2. easy installation3. very

be charged extra at the time of installation review title decent product. value for money.,value for money,improvements needed,everything thing good except the installation experience,overall taking all aspects tv is good within the price point,tv installation services,one among the good tvs in the market.,picture review content i am posting this after a few weeks of using the product.usage continuous, ott only, no cabledish operator.average daily usage 68 hours.the tv is a great valueformoney product.installation the installation was simple and amazon assisted installation was smooth, timely and hasslefree.picture the picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a sony, lg and samsung with these kind of specs. movies and especially hires tv series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hires , wouldnt look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of sony, samsung lg etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone elses better tv.sound sound output is decent. you wouldnt need additional support to enhance the volume as such.remote sleek, sensitive and userfriendly. its exactly like amazons remote.os same as any smart android tv. works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.standalone and as your first smart tv, you wouldnt find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hires from the beginning. it is a great value for money product without a doubt.however, if you are considering this as an alternative or second tv after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,picture quality is good for this price, didnt faced any lag on ui and browsing other apps. only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. overall worth for money u spend. but the installation process is just awful, amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. no demo given on tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,screen looks amazing but problem is with processor i believe. if 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickersnot so often but problem exists, even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user action.reason why i believe processor is bad because i do 4k gaming using ps5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,if you buy tv in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. when you want to buy a tv from amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. the problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. its like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you cant eat. so i ordered my tv on monday, it got delivered on friday and it will be installed on monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. if we had the technician details, we could reach out s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours before.regarding product, its good quality and very good for a average user. heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, i guess.,this tv gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1 the installation guy didnt arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didnt came for installation purpose. so strictly be aware of this point.2 the tv i got in offer with 3k discount on icici card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3 even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece i didnt got the replacement for the product and its totally unfair deal by amazon and the seller too.final verdict is the tv quality and feature are good but the service from seller and amazon that is got was very poor inspite i was prime member. the seller dawntech electronics private limited gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases amazon will not help you. thankyou,team,also to be added tv installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. no need to other subvendor to getting installation and demo. also dependency on thirdparty involvement should be less.bad experience with tv installation stuff.pls look into this .,picture quality good. sound quality not upto my 3xpectations. not able to find the real dolby stereo effect. remote not upto the mark.4 for picture quality, 3 for both sound and remote quality,good quality picture but it hangs on home screen <|>"

content about amazonbasicsxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxamazon basics was launched in 2009 is amazons own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods.here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand already exist in the market but at lower prices. simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.if something isnt an immediate hit, amazon pulls it and moves on.amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product but with amazonbasics amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.as an additional benefit, amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined immediately taken care of.about our product requirement vs actualxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxi recently purchased a new qualcomm 3 qbix car charger was looking for a cable with usb a to micro b connector. i listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements1. data exchangesince it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, data exchange capability was not much of my concern. preference though would surely have been a usb 3 but it didnt bother me if i could only get a usb 2.0 too.actual product i did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and i found it to be pretty well. i did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. the more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2. length of the cable again since i could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, i preferred to keep it short simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.actual product the cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. the length was sufficient for me to plugin any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passengers seat.3. tangle free flexibility strength standardsi am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. i wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.actual product the cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness a sturdy intermediate cable. the whole construction of the cable due its cable size flexibility is almost tanglefree.the associated cable was not exactly thick but cant be termed as thin or delicate too. its not the thickest ive seen but then thickest doesnt always means most durable. given my application its more than just suitable.the overall built quality of the cable insulation looks promising enough to last few years. even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.i had further shortlisted mansaa an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4. compact moulded connectorshad an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal pcbs.actual product there are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. the connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. the connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.the connector ports are sturdy enough both at usb a micro b ports. the micro b port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.no signs of loose construction.being goldplated is more of a misleading fancy termin this case as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5. availability of tiesvelcro straps as per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, i expected an included cable tie or a velcro strap would be a nice addon to properly adjust arrange the cable as per requirement.actual product this i miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which i could adjust my required cable length easily.6. decent current handling capabilityon the newest qc 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.actual product the actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new qc 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. here, let me clear out that the latest qc chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with qc 3.0 chargers.have tried it safely multiple times charging my samsung s7 from 10 without the cable getting hot.7. warrantycomes with a 1 year warranty as expected. not the best in the industry but reasonable.other observationsapart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are8. the cable is manufactured in china imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name philosophy of amazonbasics.9. the cable has a manufacturing date of oct 2017 it was imported to india in dec 2017.10. the cable has a mrp tag of 495 bucks however i purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11. a customer care toll free number email is also printed over the label for registration of any

wire.,good,excellent quality cable review content about amazonbasicsxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxamazon basics was launched in 2009 is amazons own inhouse brand for fast moving small electronic consumer goods.here amazon uses its massive collection of sales data to launch products that are in huge demand already exist in the market but at lower prices. simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.if something isnt an immediate hit, amazon pulls it and moves on.amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product but with amazonbasics amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.as an additional benefit, amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined immediately taken care of.about our product requirement vs actualxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxi recently purchased a new qualcomm 3 qbix car charger was looking for a cable with usb a to micro b connector. i listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements1. data exchangesince it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, data exchange capability was not much of my concern. preference though would surely have been a usb 3 but it didnt bother me if i could only get a usb 2.0 too.actual product i did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and i found it to be pretty well. i did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. the more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2. length of the cable again since i could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, i preferred to keep it short simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.actual product the cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. the length was sufficient for me to plugin any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passengers seat.3. tangle free flexibility strength standardsi am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. i wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.actual product the cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness a sturdy intermediate cable. the whole construction of the cable due its cable size flexibility is almost tanglefree.the associated cable was not exactly thick but cant be termed as thin or delicate too. its not the thickest ive seen but then thickest doesnt always means most durable. given my application its more than just suitable.the overall built quality of the cable insulation looks promising enough to last few years. even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.i had further shortlisted mansaa an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4. compact moulded connectorshad an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal pcbs.actual product there are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. the connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. the connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.the connector ports are sturdy enough both at usb a micro b ports. the micro b port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.no signs of loose construction.being goldplated is more of a misleading fancy termin this case as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5. availability of tiesvelcro straps as per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, i expected an included cable tie or a velcro strap would be a nice addon to properly adjust arrange the cable as per requirement.actual product this i miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which i could adjust my required cable length easily.6. decent current handling capabilityon the newest qc 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.actual product the actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new qc 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. here, let me clear out that the latest qc chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with qc 3.0 chargers.have tried it safely multiple times charging my samsung s7 from 10 without the cable getting hot.7. warrantycomes with a 1 year warranty as expected. not the best in the industry but reasonable.other observationsapart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are8. the cable is manufactured in china imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name philosophy of amazonbasics.9. the cable has a manufacturing date of oct 2017 it was imported to india in dec 2017.10. the cable has a mrp tag of 495 bucks however i purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11. a customer care toll free number email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.final verdictxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxit has been few days since i have received been using this product. so far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 i suppose, its worth it.will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,worth for buy,the quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon

weight and handy to install.3. easy to install and mount to wall.4. tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. it gets integrated with mobile apps, remote, wifi networks very quickly and easily.6. the overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. it supports all the smart features like netflix, prime and youtube. it is easily installable and signin to start using quickly.8. it is also easy to scan the setup box channels and start viewing them.cons1. picture quality is 776p. its average and not very clear. but it is worth the price range. ill not complaint as the cost of tv is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. bluetooth and wifi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. i encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.rest all is very good and loved this product. i feel it was worth ordering. if you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and dont have extensive smart use then 100 go for this.if you want to use a lot of smart features and ott platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full hd and 4k quality. this tv will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but its very good for daily family shows and tv channels.one last thing i want to express and im ver disappointed about is this.i got my order delivered on friday and i scheduled my installation for saturday. but nobody turned up that day and i had to reschedule it for tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. i got a call from amazon to reschedule it for tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.this is very very bad and irresponsible service by oneplus and amazon. im very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. a company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.what do you guys expect us to do wait for 5 to 6 days to get my tv installed even when its been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. even when im having my smart tv delivered to my home, i have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.at least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. you should take care that the money i spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. highly disappointed with this behavior and service.,good product,connectivity is faster,but performance is little bit slower,,the biggest problem i face is it dont have a aux cable so im not able to connect my sound bar......the hdmi port is useless it wont work .so,i connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it wont connect automatically, everytime i on the tv i need to connect it manually its a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now its been 4 months and its super laggy .....even after the update its just the same.....yeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstanding......thats all,good quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice. budget friendly, im happy with this .,after a few days, the tv will perform slowly and the remote is very very sentence,thank you amazon and oneplus,1. sound is good2. easy installation3. very slim and less weight4. voice recognition is good,likebudgetfriendlydislikewifi connectivity range is poor.many times gets disconnected.color depth not that good. <|>"

features not matching the description provided review title decent product. value for money.,value for money,improvements needed,everything thing good except the installation experience,overall taking all aspects tv is good within the price point,tv installation services,one among the good tvs in the market.,picture review content i am posting this after a few weeks of using the product.usage continuous, ott only, no cabledish operator.average daily usage 68 hours.the tv is a great valueformoney product.installation the installation was simple and amazon assisted installation was smooth, timely and hasslefree.picture the picture quality is not great when compared with the smoothness of a sony, lg and samsung with these kind of specs. movies and especially hires tv series experience was somewhat diluted as most of the times, the output, while in hires , wouldnt look like a movie quality which we are used to of watching in the likes of sony, samsung lg etc however, with time, you get used to it and only realize the difference when you see the same movie at someone elses better tv.sound sound output is decent. you wouldnt need additional support to enhance the volume as such.remote sleek, sensitive and userfriendly. its exactly like amazons remote.os same as any smart android tv. works smoothly without much lags or hiccups. switching apps from one to another takes a a couple of seconds more than sony but unless you have used to of those performances, it looks just fine.standalone and as your first smart tv, you wouldnt find any reasons to not like the quality and it would like hires from the beginning. it is a great value for money product without a doubt.however, if you are considering this as an alternative or second tv after owning the better ones in the past, you will have a hard time adjusting with it.,picture quality is good for this price, didnt faced any lag on ui and browsing other apps. only negative will be audio, definitely need a sound bar if u are a frequent movie watcher. overall worth for money u spend. but the installation process is just awful, amazon claiming that a trained professional will visit for installation but neither they are trained nor professionals , just read the installation manuals and installed the wall mount which took 4hours for them to buy the wall mount after charging money. no demo given on tv as they have no idea about the product, these things making to think twice or thrice to buy a tv through online.,screen looks amazing but problem is with processor i believe. if 4k content is getting streamed on device then we can observe the green screen flickersnot so often but problem exists, even remote control is not good as it take at least 2 sec to react for the user action.reason why i believe processor is bad because i do 4k gaming using ps5 and never encountered problem with the screen.,if you buy tv in a small town shop, it will be delivered and installed immediately within couple of hours. when you want to buy a tv from amazon, you need to wait for it to be delivered for couple of days and it is understandable. the problem is with the installation, they take so much time to install that you end up regretting buying the product. its like you are hungry and food is in front of you but you cant eat. so i ordered my tv on monday, it got delivered on friday and it will be installed on monday because of weekend where as there is no concept of weekend in small towns. if we had the technician details, we could reach out s get it installed but that also will be shared 4 hours before.regarding product, its good quality and very good for a average user. heavy duty like games and continuous usage on some store will be challenging, i guess.,this tv gives good results within the budget, should definitely buy if the budget is 30k but most important point like to mention is after sales service and also the installation part.1 the installation guy didnt arrive at very first day that was scheduled, even after rescheduling he didnt came for installation purpose. so strictly be aware of this point.2 the tv i got in offer with 3k discount on icici card but although the product came out defective, it had dead pixel on the display which is very bad after period of time.3 even after the fault was from seller as it was defective piece i didnt got the replacement for the product and its totally unfair deal by amazon and the seller too.final verdict is the tv quality and feature are good but the service from seller and amazon that is got was very poor inspite i was prime member. the seller dawntech electronics private limited gives very poor service and feel bad that in such cases amazon will not help you. thankyou,team,also to be added tv installation services with product while delivering and unboxing. no need to other subvendor to getting installation and demo. also dependency on thirdparty involvement should be less.bad experience with tv installation stuff.pls look into this .,picture quality good. sound quality not upto my 3xpectations. not able to find the real dolby stereo effect. remote not upto the mark.4 for picture quality, 3 for both sound and remote quality,good quality picture but it hangs on home screen <|>"

cheap hanging hook that had mrp inr116 on it and asked for inr499 for it without any receipt. he kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. however, it clearly had mrp mentioned on it2. i went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just inr200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. he just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws which i had bought with him. after about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. and for all this, he kept cussing me that i wasted his time. there was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.this whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. this was the worst installation experience in my life so far.bottomline please do not avail the so called free installation service from amazon. it is just a scam. instead call the acer support. they will do the job much better.,after using it for 2 months, here are its pros and conspros 1. great picture quality. its awesome.2. blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. sound with 30db is very good4. looks great with thin besel5. remote comes with favorite ott buttons.6. content upscaling is very good.cons1. remote could have been better. cant use dth remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. remote operation is bit complex.3. motion technology not great. there is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson ott, but it decreases when you switch to dth.overall, its a nice buy at this price point. i think i am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. i am satisfied with the product.,product has good picture quality. good product at that price with 25w sound. applications running smoothly. 3 months older no issues yet. its running smoothly.,you get decent features for the price you pay. screen resolution might be. set back as you may find pixalation. overall its good,i am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p hd ready tv. it is truly an amazing panel. i found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. the speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. however, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the tv is wall mounted or kept on a stand.the remote is good, voice search works well for me. tv start up takes a long time in my opinion, but i have not compared it against any other 32 inch tv and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 ghz wifi works very well even across walls. only negative aspect i faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphonesearphones. firstly, the connection sometimes doesnt happen automatically after a restart which means i have to remove and rediscover the device thru the menu which is not simple. secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the tv, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 23 inches.however, i am still super happy with this tv. i got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,at this price range11499it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is goodsometimes lagging.no major issues found on this tv.just go for it.,vellu for money. good product,very nice productsave money <|>"

worth it.pros1. sound is awesome 100 satisfied with the quality of sound. dolby audio 20w speakers are really great for sure affordable tv.2. size and slim it is slim and looks stylish. very light weight and handy to install.3. easy to install and mount to wall.4. tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. it gets integrated with mobile apps, remote, wifi networks very quickly and easily.6. the overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. it supports all the smart features like netflix, prime and youtube. it is easily installable and signin to start using quickly.8. it is also easy to scan the setup box channels and start viewing them.cons1. picture quality is 776p. its average and not very clear. but it is worth the price range. ill not complaint as the cost of tv is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. bluetooth and wifi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. i encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.rest all is very good and loved this product. i feel it was worth ordering. if you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and dont have extensive smart use then 100 go for this.if you want to use a lot of smart features and ott platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full hd and 4k quality. this tv will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but its very good for daily family shows and tv channels.one last thing i want to express and im ver disappointed about is this.i got my order delivered on friday and i scheduled my installation for saturday. but nobody turned up that day and i had to reschedule it for tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. i got a call from amazon to reschedule it for tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.this is very very bad and irresponsible service by oneplus and amazon. im very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. a company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.what do you guys expect us to do wait for 5 to 6 days to get my tv installed even when its been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. even when im having my smart tv delivered to my home, i have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.at least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. you should take care that the money i spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. highly disappointed with this behavior and service.,good product,connectivity is faster,but performance is little bit slower,,the biggest problem i face is it dont have a aux cable so im not able to connect my sound bar......the hdmi port is useless it wont work .so,i connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it wont connect automatically, everytime i on the tv i need to connect it manually its a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now its been 4 months and its super laggy .....even after the update its just the same.....yeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstanding......thats all,good quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice. budget friendly, im happy with this .,after a few days, the tv will perform slowly and the remote is very very sentence,thank you amazon and oneplus,1. sound is good2. easy installation3. very slim and less weight4. voice recognition is good,likebudgetfriendlydislikewifi connectivity range is poor.many times gets disconnected.color depth not that good. <|>"

cheap hanging hook that had mrp inr116 on it and asked for inr499 for it without any receipt. he kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. however, it clearly had mrp mentioned on it2. i went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just inr200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. he just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws which i had bought with him. after about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. and for all this, he kept cussing me that i wasted his time. there was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.this whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. this was the worst installation experience in my life so far.bottomline please do not avail the so called free installation service from amazon. it is just a scam. instead call the acer support. they will do the job much better.,after using it for 2 months, here are its pros and conspros 1. great picture quality. its awesome.2. blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. sound with 30db is very good4. looks great with thin besel5. remote comes with favorite ott buttons.6. content upscaling is very good.cons1. remote could have been better. cant use dth remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. remote operation is bit complex.3. motion technology not great. there is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson ott, but it decreases when you switch to dth.overall, its a nice buy at this price point. i think i am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. i am satisfied with the product.,product has good picture quality. good product at that price with 25w sound. applications running smoothly. 3 months older no issues yet. its running smoothly.,you get decent features for the price you pay. screen resolution might be. set back as you may find pixalation. overall its good,i am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p hd ready tv. it is truly an amazing panel. i found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. the speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. however, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the tv is wall mounted or kept on a stand.the remote is good, voice search works well for me. tv start up takes a long time in my opinion, but i have not compared it against any other 32 inch tv and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 ghz wifi works very well even across walls. only negative aspect i faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphonesearphones. firstly, the connection sometimes doesnt happen automatically after a restart which means i have to remove and rediscover the device thru the menu which is not simple. secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the tv, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 23 inches.however, i am still super happy with this tv. i got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,at this price range11499it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is goodsometimes lagging.no major issues found on this tv.just go for it.,vellu for money. good product,very nice productsave money <|>"

cheap hanging hook that had mrp inr116 on it and asked for inr499 for it without any receipt. he kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. however, it clearly had mrp mentioned on it2. i went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just inr200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. he just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws which i had bought with him. after about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. and for all this, he kept cussing me that i wasted his time. there was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.this whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. this was the worst installation experience in my life so far.bottomline please do not avail the so called free installation service from amazon. it is just a scam. instead call the acer support. they will do the job much better.,after using it for 2 months, here are its pros and conspros 1. great picture quality. its awesome.2. blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. sound with 30db is very good4. looks great with thin besel5. remote comes with favorite ott buttons.6. content upscaling is very good.cons1. remote could have been better. cant use dth remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. remote operation is bit complex.3. motion technology not great. there is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson ott, but it decreases when you switch to dth.overall, its a nice buy at this price point. i think i am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. i am satisfied with the product.,product has good picture quality. good product at that price with 25w sound. applications running smoothly. 3 months older no issues yet. its running smoothly.,you get decent features for the price you pay. screen resolution might be. set back as you may find pixalation. overall its good,i am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p hd ready tv. it is truly an amazing panel. i found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. the speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. however, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the tv is wall mounted or kept on a stand.the remote is good, voice search works well for me. tv start up takes a long time in my opinion, but i have not compared it against any other 32 inch tv and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 ghz wifi works very well even across walls. only negative aspect i faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphonesearphones. firstly, the connection sometimes doesnt happen automatically after a restart which means i have to remove and rediscover the device thru the menu which is not simple. secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the tv, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 23 inches.however, i am still super happy with this tv. i got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,at this price range11499it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also google voice support is goodsometimes lagging.no major issues found on this tv.just go for it.,vellu for money. good product,very nice productsave money <|>"

inr116 on it and asked for inr499 for it without any receipt. he kept telling that it was not for sale and company had sent this specially. however, it clearly had mrp mentioned on it2. i went to market and bought a much better cabinet for just inr200 and for installation of that as well, technician was really adamant to drill the two required holes on top. he just drilled one on top and one on bottom and kept all the other spare screws which i had bought with him. after about half an hour of arguments, he finally drilled the other required holes. and for all this, he kept cussing me that i wasted his time. there was no assistance from the person who represented the service agency as well.this whole process took me two hours to complete that too with lots of arguments. this was the worst installation experience in my life so far.bottomline please do not avail the so called free installation service from amazon. it is just a scam. instead call the acer support. they will do the job much better.,after using it for 2 months, here are its pros and conspros 1. great picture quality. its awesome.2. blacks are very good and is adjustable.3. sound with 30db is very good4. looks great with thin besel5. remote comes with favorite ott buttons.6. content upscaling is very good.cons1. remote could have been better. cant use dth remote to turn on both televisison and set top box.2. remote operation is bit complex.3. motion technology not great. there is a noticeable blur when watching moving ballson ott, but it decreases when you switch to dth.overall, its a nice buy at this price point. i think i am getting fairly better picture quality and sound. i am satisfied with the product.,product has good picture quality. good product at that price with 25w sound. applications running smoothly. 3 months older no issues yet. its running smoothly.,you get decent features for the price you pay. screen resolution might be. set back as you may find pixalation. overall its good,i am amazed with the picture quality of this 720p hd ready tv. it is truly an amazing panel. i found it suitable for a viewing distance of between 6 to 10 feet. any nearer it may not look very crisp and any farther, it will feel like a very small size. the speakers are also very good for the price and can get very loud without any distortions. however, since the speaker is downward firing, the experience will vary based on whether the tv is wall mounted or kept on a stand.the remote is good, voice search works well for me. tv start up takes a long time in my opinion, but i have not compared it against any other 32 inch tv and hence do not know where it stands among peers.5 ghz wifi works very well even across walls. only negative aspect i faced is w.r.t the experience of using my bluetooth headphonesearphones. firstly, the connection sometimes doesnt happen automatically after a restart which means i have to remove and rediscover the device thru the menu which is not simple. secondly, the signal itself seems to be very weak and even at a distance of 8 feet in front of the tv, the signal breaks even if you move your head by 23 inches.however, i am still super happy with this tv. i got it for 8k during the launch offer and it is totally worth it and is recommended from my side.,at this price range11499it is good quality product on this market..acer only should work with sound quality improvement otherwise all ok.picture quality really impressive,wifi connectivity good,easy to install,boderless screen design is premium and also

edge ahead by also supporting toslink optical cable input and output so your tv with optical sound output can feed the adapter, and your audio system can also wireless connect with the bluetooth adapter for home stereo.connect 2 devices simultaneously two bluetooth headphones or speakers can pair at once so children can watch in silence and give parents a much needed break.always on no need to charge, as device does not come with any battery. instead keep it powered and enjoy hassle free transmission of audio from the device. review title good,does the job. works with two devices,positive review almost good and useful,hissing sound output from vise tv vijay sales.,acceptable sound, no hassle of charging,excellent product,not good range,very good review content atlast i connected successfully. working good. but sound volume clarity not adequate. durability, to be assessed. dear amazon.in, tell the seller to write connecting procedure clearly.manual printing also is bad. i had to struggle.,does what it says. works well to connect two bluetooth devices to any other device like a laptop, smart tv, etc. can take a bit of time to pair two devices. but the manual in the box helps.sound quality over aux cable too is good. so, even if you do not have a digital output or rca you can still use it. bit bit flimsy and delicate. but then you dont need to move it around everyday.,disadvantage the sound and video lag with distance while connecting bluetooth with headphones.pairing with headphones difficult need to wait longfeels volumes low.,,i got this to addon to a highend system, which traditionally doesnt have the facility. however its often requested when guests come over. i was using a phoenix transreceiver, but the constant need of charging and the single indicator led made it difficult to integrate into this kind of application. the optical out is connected to a dual ess9028 dac, and the device used for transmission is the ipad air.this lacks a battery, which is a big differentiator. this means it is not exactly portable, and the form factor reinforces that feature. it is intended to be a desktop unit, and it comes with a reasonable set of cables. the quality of the included cables is quite poor, so its best to use something else.compared to the direct input from usb, the overall sound is poorer, with a shrunken soundstage and coarse vocals and treble. still, this is being used in a highend system i suspect with many lesser speakerampdacs it will be acceptable. at maximum output, the level is about 12db lower than a direct usb connection to the dac.it is around the same as my signature acoustics unit, which is 13rd the size but uses a battery, and doesnt have a volume control or the bypass feature, or the nice display which is handy if you are close by.the bypass is one of the highlights of this device, it basically connects the two optical ports together in passthrough, and allows you to use both bt and another optical sourcereceiver though only either can be used at a time.the build quality is average. it is lightweight enough that a set of decent cables will tip it over backwards, hence the thin cables supplied. the onboard volume control is nice, if a bit redundant given everybody uses their handheld or other device to control volume i use the dac remote. it also has only 16 clicks, so the control will be very coarse. the display has no spelling errors and while the resolution is low, it is sufficient for the tasks.overall, its quite expensive but is more kitted out than similar devices. the sound quality limitations of bt transmission compulsory resampling and lossy compression, among others cannot be overcome even with the fanciest devices and protocols, so id rank it close to the top of what you can get as an addon for a hifi system. for more normal usage, there are cheaper options available.,excellent product,bluetooth range is very less,bought it to connect my old sony 5.1 blueray home theater with mi 4k box which does not have optical sound port. it has an spdif optical port which can connect to the home theater optical in <|>"

remote not working,in simple words, please dont buy this mi tv and especially from amazonthis seller sold by cloudtail india and fulfilled by amazon.if you have patience and able to understand normal englishi dont have writing skills to share exactly my feelingspain then please go through my following experiencefeedback to know why i said dont buy it.dont wanna give single star but not allowing this site to post without starreason to buy trust amazonby looking at the 4.3 out of 5 rating and 1 best seller tag i got interest on this tv. as we have trust on amazon and also as it was coming in my budget with good features i purchased this mi 4a pro tv.but, seems majority of good reviewratings are paid ones. these are cheating us, off course they didnt force to buy, but being middle class personhuman being we may get attract to things which showing better in less price. seems this madegave opportunity to these sellers to cheat us.amazon delivery feedback i may not comment on all deliveries happening not safely but when it came to me its not delivered safely.this tv came for home delivery in troalley auto without proper placementsafety, asked delivery person why alone kept it while coming due to up and downs of road it may fly right. he didnt listen my words, simply said will take it back if any physical damage.he only open it and as outside nothing see damage, delivery person said if any inner damage during installation time technician came to know and will replace it and he forced me to tell otp to accept me deliver and left.tv installation feedback did by amazon technician personinstead mi technician, amazon technician came and installed this mi tv. i got it installed stand mount as wall mount not freely providing.technician somehow explained tv usage but thinking as not mi person not have full knowledge and exploring and telling each details.however, normal usage of tv, this amazon technician help is fine.tv experiencefirst day having slight less picture quality and few showing pixels not as required for eye safeness.after 3 or 4 days picture quality came better. soundaudio quality was good either on ottyoutbe or setup boxdthup to 11 days as we not used much and simply using it for watch dth channels. everything looks good.after 12 days amazon replacement time expired then started showing soundaudio problem.tv sound coming very slow, when installed timefirst 10 days, if we set up volume 15 or 20 it was able give bigger sound, now though we increase volume 60 or 65 not giving the sound that we heard when it installedsetup played the same content which we listen in youtube when after installation completed.regarding this yesterday raised request, online service person asked me to update build version to latest, now, it is pl.6036 but still have the same problem.2 or 3 days ago while watching suddenly tv got turned off, we did power off and on then it got switch on usually, also after sometime did screen mirroring of youtube and tried decreasing volume from mobile it worked. but, not sure what problem, we believe after that time onwards we have this sound issues.not sure, seems as i bought from this amazon or mi service itself does magic to convey customer without actually solving problem.online service person instead sending technician to home for verifying problem. told and did build version update with me to latest software update. later, he said volume limit got increased to 100 now, we have to increase the volume level double or triple to have same sound which have prior. i.e. before if 1520 volume level gives big sound, then now 5060 volume level the same sound. asked, when limit increased it should give much more sound otherwise what is the use of volume limit increase. but, he told ottsome apps will show difference of this new feature, at the time as i have been on this calls and worries, got tired, i said will see and get back to you with new request.after some time, when i visited my friends better knowledge person on this problem came to know that he cheated me without solving problem, simply said some words to conveytired us.off course, i can hear sound at 60 or 70 volume but my concern is after purchaseinstallation of 13 days only i got this problem, in future how it works and how many further problems shows to me making me cruise.being middle class person, we give value to single rupee also because we know how much efforts we put on to get that money. after purchase of this mi product crying lot why we went to it instead we could have went for further good brand product though they high in cost.now, not replaced my tv or not did service by technician. we decided that we got cheated on and prayed god to take care,bought two years ago. my panel stopped displaying just one week before the warranty was to expire after two years. they promptly replaced it with a new one. i did not even spend one rupee extra. hasslefree. highly recommend buying mi products. the product is also awesome.,good,best product <|>"

earbuds,buds i love,unique form factor,best call quality ear buds,good but is it worth it,bluetooth range not that good,excellent sounding pair of earbuds with one fatal flaw,bluetooth connectivity is not upto the mark review content the earphones have good clear sound quality. it lacks base. battery backup is good. anc is a myth in this earphone. it might hurt your ear if you wear it for longer duration depending on the shape of your ear,eat easily fit in ears and light weight ,and sound quality is good too. over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile too.,bought this solely due to its form factor to try how samsung has made them to sound in this open bud style. to be true samsung has managed excellently to give us an unique tws.this is not an inear style tws but resembles somewhat earbud style tws, only of its kind in the market as far as my knowledge goes.they are held very good in my ears, gives me a good seal and does not fall out strange as i cant use earbuds because they fall out frequently. it seems that samsung has finalised the shape after a good homework. however, it doesnt mean that it will fit everybody as there are many dissatisfied users around the globe.the finish, build and all such generic factors are top notch. the size of the buds and the case is very small.now about the sound. if the buds fit in ones ears with a good seal, the sound is full bodied but if the seal is not perfect, it may be tinny.the sound signature is very bassy for my taste and i have to eq it to my taste. the bass is so pounding that sometimes it becomes difficult to get a taste of the treble. i listen it in treble boost mode adjusted through the app. anc works strangely and noise reduction is not very decipherable. in contrary, anc on somewhat opens up the sound. dont buy this for anc.strangely to me, these buds sound better on my iphone 12mini than my galaxy s22 spotify and apple music. the buds have app support for both android galaxy wear and ios galaxy buds live but the android app is more feature packed and works better. the ios app couldnt update the firmware although there is a menu in the app and always showed the device to be on latest firmware. however, as soon as i connected with my s22, on pairing, the first thing it did was to update the firmware.i love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for 4.4k against an mrp of 16k. the do sound very good but does not suit my taste. persons loving bass may love them. dont get them for anc. battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok. it has wireless charging too. if your ears are too small or too large than normal better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving a improper seal.,best call quality. noise cancelling could have been improved to best, but still wotks good.descent battery life.music is good. not to that top notch, but good in this segment.overall worth for buying with good call quality a very little to compromise but good.,i am using this for like 3 months it is a good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not a part then do not buy it its not worth its price.,bluetooth range is not that good,the sound quality is extremely good for a tws and the sound signature is almost flat. i got these for rs.5290, it almost felt like a steal deal for me until i faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds. the bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance. it feels like i am using bluetooth v3.0. the range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket, the audio starts stuttering. the mic quality is a hit or miss, inside the house it works very well, but outside it performs poorly. i think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphones quality. if you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception, then do a google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing. samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault. i pity those who bought it at around 15k for such a flawed product. even at rs 5k it is not worth it because of the range issue. it is better to buy a wired iem, atleast it will sound better than this.,in this price samsung brand is goodeasy to wear and good battery backuphardly support the 2 meter bluetooth connectivity <|>"

this powerbank to use during my vacation with family. it is sturdy but a bit on heavier side. can charge three phones at a time if you use the two usb and third type c port as well for charging. the speed of charging is alright and appropriate. the one and only drawback i experienced is the weight of the powerbank itself, without this limitation it could be really amazing product to buy.,bit heavy but does its job. takes tooooooo much time to charge. whatever mention in the description is not correct at all with regards to the powerbank charging.,i needed an extra power bank with a larger

2019 with everything forced in congested space. the issue i had in this one was that it came with open seal no poly wrap around product box as if it was a used product or was tampered in between. so was skeptical about the authenticity of the product and ordered a replacement right away. this one had usb c cable but no carry pouch.2. when replacement came, it came in a polywrapped bigger box 22x10x4 cm, mfg oct 2019 with an outer sleeve and main box inside with a hologram seal. maybe ambrane changed the packaging. the hologram seal here was intact but was also not applied properly to secure the opening. looked like it was applied with an open box. so its presence was useless. this one came with micro usb cable and a carry pouch. carry pouch as per my analysis carry pouch comes with the latest october lot which comes in a bigger box and was unavailable in earlier lot with a small box. carry pouch size was appropriate for power bank and i had no trouble inserting power bank in it. some users reported it having a smaller opening but i had no trouble with it and found it to be a proper fit. neither loose nor tight. its soft nylon meshed pouch and is a nice addon. verdict at the price point its not a bad deal. its a midway path bw low quality and highquality ones. you can very well go for ambrane, as it makes good quality durable power banks. rest, nothing is perfect in this world. for this thing only, 10 days replacement policy from amazon and 1year warranty from ambrame is available. if one can extend the budget by a few hundred, mi power bank will be a better option with a metallic body better quality overall. i have mi, honor ambrane power bank and their overall rating will be from low to high ambrane honor mi,i am putting up this review after 1 day of usage. this is the second power bank i have bought from ambrane india overall third power bank for my family. before to this i have bought their pp30 30000 mah model and also has mi 2i 20000 mah power bank both were really good, here i am putting together all the pros and cons which i am able to find after 1 day of usage and also a little bit of comparison. my dad uses redmi note 7, my mom has mi a1 and i am using redmi note 3pros dual input type c and micro usb this is the foremost and primary reason of choosing this power bank over mi or other brands as you dont need to carry two cables if your phone has type c input which in my family 2 out of 3 has the same easy to carry and hold as it is very compact is size i must say in comparison to mi or ambrane pp30 solid and sturdy built 20000 mah capacity with same lithium polymer batteries these are safer then lithium ion batteries, this i came to know while buying this product 200 cheaper price than mi touch button at the top to know the power status this is something unique it took less than 1 hour to charge my redmi note 3 from 13 to 100 at 2 cell battery indicator, which is pretty good and almost equivalent to my wall charger best part same time and charging speed in delhi metro i dont know either it is pro or con, both of my other power banks supports qualcomm quick charge 3.0 technology while this power bank supports only fast charging at 2.4 amp, but i feel this has charged my phone better and faster than mi power bank itself. i know a phone must also supports quick charge technology for fast charging but when i use quick charge on my dads redmi note 7 which supports qc 4.0 either from mi power bank or ambrane pp30 power bank it kind of heats up the phone, also it fluctuates the power and automatically switches between quick charge and fast charging which affects your battery life, so it is safer to charge the phone at optimum current at 2.4 ampcons very stuffy packaging, it looks like the power bank has been forced fully stuffed inside the box it has some adhesive tape at the top i dont know why which, when you remove it, puts scratches on the top, be careful while removing the same no torch light, their pp30 have it only micro cable inside the box,definitely heavy but i knew this. i will recommend this, as it has 2 slots so we can charge two phones.,nice product,power backup is good.. but the usb cable provided is very bad. it stopped working after few months of usage,everything is good but the battery dont last that long when use for charging two device. <|>"

review title beast in budget,fake negative reviews.,great product under low price range review content bought it in january,posting it in august. so ive used it almost 6 months and giving honest review.in short if you are getting it during sale time 899999,then its a steal deal..also in regular price bw 12991499 its a good product..sound quality is good. enough loud at 5060 volume. bass is also ok. whenever needed it produces punchy bass. overall balanced.mic quality is good in indoor condition,but in noisy environment you cant rely on this. recevier cant clearly listen to you.you can do gaming as company claiming low latency,i myself didnt test it.now about battery backup,company claim it will give battery backup of 42 hours with case. 6 hours in single chargeadditional 36 hours6 times charge via case. but in practical use it gives total 35 hours playback. it will give around 5 hours backup on single charge of buds 5060 volumeif you only listen to music or watching video,but no call or gaming you can charge the earbuds full 6 times via case so additional 30 hours.just one issue with its design,suit case type box not easy to carry in pocket. i would say its a personal preference. if you are into good looks,design then its not for you.now its regular pricing varries between rs 12991499. in this price range also it is one of the best tws under 1500. i will tell why.. now a days many brands are launching tws in the market under 1500. most of them sound almost similar, difference is like 1920 they are just marketing their tws with huge hours of battery backup by youtubers,reviewers. 4850 hours of playtime is just myth. ive personally used trukeairbuds lite,buds f1 which is by far the most false promising brand claiming 48 hours of battery in their every tws,but only give 21 hours. even other tws of boatairdopes 121 pro which claim 4045 hours playback only give around 25 hours,defy gravity z claiming 50 hours only give 28 hours. if you are impressed by their looks huge battery backup and thinking to buy those,you will be disappointed after purchase. instead go with this,you will not be disappointed.,i read the negative comments first and decided not to buy it because the comments said it gives high latency on gaming like pubg and also it falls from ear while running. and that the difference between normal and beast mode slightly had differencebut a pubg youtuber recommended me this so i decided to give it a try, after trying out myself.let me provide the facts for youi have a boat rockerz 510 headphone which obviously should be better than this airdope but this airdope surprised me by doing 2x better in providing accurate sound in pubg.its been 23 days i used it daily for 67 hours on full charge, it has no buttons and it works on touch sensor which was impressive for me and in pubg it doesnt give delay as written in the comments, it has a good latency better than what i had expected from the negative comments.sometimes though i faced the issue where one side of the airdope stops working because its either on standby without detecting the user or a bug which is included in the faqguidehelp card in the box im satisfied in terms of gaming.for sports like running i wouldnt recommend because it slips away however maybe u can tie the airdope with a thread attached to ur neck so that its safe from landing on the ground im gonna try that, please dont use both the airdopes while running on the roads with vehicles running for your own safety keep one side of your ear free for hearing sounds from your environment.,pros1. the level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if youre at the gym, these are perfect.2. awesome bass3. noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u wont be able to hear things around u very well, its great for places like gym.4. lovely battery life, ive had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. and the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and youll be getting battery for a long long while.5. they are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.6. affordable7. the touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. can also pick up calls just by tapping.8. multiple ear coverings are provided with it.9. type c portcons1. the sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. the bass is the highlight so its great for music, but for movies or gaming, you wont get the most crisp audio.2. some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my bluetooth on and off many times for it to work this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence edit after 1 month use its now a very frequent issue3. the mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on pc4. sometimes on whatsapp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. not an issue if you are the one dialing i hope its just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.overall, i needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there lol so im very very happy with themhighly recommended for music andor as a more affordable option as compared to jbl etc. <|>"

product,good,one of the best mouse for the price,good holding good dpi easy to use,value for money,nice mouse review content hi guys bought this yesterday, so havent used it much, so an early review. but the most detailed review so please read till the end. very important points are mentioned.looks are cute it looks really nice and elegant. i am using it with a macbook air. so far it seems there are no problems using it. the scrolling is smooth, connection does not drop, and there is no lag. connection is instant. there is no pairing required. its plug and play along with the dongle provided with it.it sits low on the table, feels weighty but not in a wrong way. the battery adds to its weight, but i have used heavier mice before, and this one feels just right. it has good grip. nothing to complain about that.buttons are nice and clicks are satisfactory, not too noisy they are just right. scroll wheel doesnt feel cheap at all, though i believe it couldve been better quality. body is matt finish and doesnt leave fingerprints on it, though if youre someone who eats and handles the mouse, then itll show the oil prints and thats true with any peripherals. the mouse doesnt feel cheap overall, but it is definitely plasticky, though not in the bad sense. it is definitely not cheap looks wise.there is an on, off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery which is included when the mouse is not in use. there is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light. so thats a good thing and a definite plus the overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse, and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with it.now over to a major flaw. the mouse connects only though its own usb dongle which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself, inside the battery door, which i found mighty impressive and not through the laptops bluetooth. now this means two things 1. you have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go, which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse, then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario. and worse still, if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle, then youre stuck and i dont think you get only the dongle youll have to check that with the seller, and then the mouse is left useless in that case. 2. now over to the problem i am facing, which i did not see anyone else mention in their reviews. i use a macbook, so it doesnt have usbc inputs, which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle. i actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me, but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector, which is not cheap, because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive macbook. of course that is a problem with the macbook and not with the mouse, but consider this point. it is very important. it will not connect over macbooks bluetooth. otherwise, it works well with the macbook. the only caveat i found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast. youll have to get used to that thing. it doesnt feel very natural as the trackpad on the macbook feels because of that speed problem, but otherwise, the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesnt jump around, at least with my mouse. also, the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad, and i feel it could have been made better. but i guess at the cost, you really cant complain too much.overall, i think a good buy, but the compulsion of having to use it with its own dongle is a major drawback i feel. if that doesnt bother you, then nothing else should keep you from buying this product, especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks, which is what it cost me.,the quality of power button is very low easily it can break,nice product, works as expected as of now no issues,good,very smooth, works on almost every surface, paper, table, cloth etc.theres a bit rattle sound of the plastic which is just above the buttons rightleft clicksit will not bother most of you, i am a bit obsessive with these kind of things, so...personally i opened the mouse and stuck a paper inside the plastic which presses the click button, resulting in no rattle sound. now mouse only makes sound when you click the buttons, click click clickbattery life of logitech is known to be very good.,quality good, dpi good, good accuracy on off switch available, smooth, good deal at reasonable price.,good product on which you can use for long time,this is good mouse, thanks to amazon for providing this product at reasonable price. very sharp and correct working mouse. <|>"

budget and beast in quality,best quality this product,ear phone with jack,nice,good,good sound quality,value for money review content recieved damaged product the first time, the seller is very good and quickly replaced it for a new one. go for bassheads 242 if you are spending this much. they are charging more for the metal enclosure and the braided cable. the angled jack is a plus but the sound quality is soso. infinity zip 100 and their own bassheads 242 are way better for sound.,i would like to start by saying im not an audiophile, therefore my review will be less about the audio quality of the product and more about the over all experience regarding the product. first off, this is my second time buying the product and you guessed it, its good enough that i will buy it a third time if need beupon unboxing we are greeted by the presence of 3 pair of extra ear buds . there is also a pair of ear fins in the packet containing the extra ear buds, these ear fins are used to keep the ear buds snugly in your ears during strenuous periods of use where there is a chance of lots of movement. more on this later.coming to the ear phones itself, its among the very few ear phones that genuinely feels premium in hand. it is very durable, specially the plug part that connects to your phone, many a time my ear phones stop working because the plug part malfunctions and causes problems in the functioning of the ear phones. this is not the case with these.the wire itself is made of rubbersilicon. it feels good in hand and the only thing i can think of that could be improved here is to braid the wire but so far the wire hasnt showed any form of wear and tear common with most other ear phone wires. another thing to emphasize is that the entire cable is flat through out, this genuinely decreases the number of instances where i find myself trying to untangle the wire. this is truly one of the best features of this pair of earphones.remember i said something about the ear phones being made completely of metal well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter. both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin. i dont know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face. it is to be noted that the mic piece is a universal single button type and hence cannot control volume, personally this problem didnt affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be a deal breaker.mic quality is subject to individual bias therefore i can tell you my personal experience. in my opinion i feel that the quality is average, it wont blow anyones mind but it will deliver most of the time. a common complaint i heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is a significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic, these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the boat bassheads 152finally the most important part of the review, the sound quality of the ear phones. as i said earlier i wont be going into the technical details . i am a bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place. in my opinion i found that the bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the extra bass versions of the sony line up of earphones trend to be. the volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not i use it at less than half its total volume when listening to music. the clarity of the boat bassheads 152 are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the 2000 inr price category this is one other reason why i love this pair so much. a point to remember, as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones. this becomes a double edged sword, on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic. this causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used. the find unlike the ones find in lets say the newer bose ear phones arent as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over a prolonged time.last but not the least, there are multiple color variants of the boat bassheads 152 including red, black and blue. i found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but i find it to be the best of the three. that said i do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color. this leaves out the red, for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales, therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they last.pros1 no metal build2 excellent wire quality and trendy3 durable4 above average sound qualitycons1 metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily2 supplied fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time3 supplied clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easilyi hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the bassheads 220. all suggestions are welcome.thanking you, dwarakesh,best quality i like boat earphone saund quality,only disadvantage i noticed was this cant be use in usb phones, 3.5 mm jack is provided so it can be usedin jack phones only .,nice,good,i used this headphone for travel. very lite and easy to carry in

decent all rounder.,all good but multiple pairing is awful,good product by boat,good product but not wellfinished at a fair price of 1599 review content as i browsed various multiple earphones in this range on a notsobusy workday break, i came across this very featurepacked product. it seemed interesting and had something called dirac opteo in it anc. so i thought id give it a shot.firstday impressions its blown me awayexhaustive list of impressions1. dirac opteo balanced sound with punchy bass yeah, and not booming bass. its so great and im quite surprised it sounds like something youd expect at a higher price point. 1.1 soundstage as soon as the headphone is switched on, it starts in battery saving mode. once you turn on dirac opteo mode, you can literally feel the space opening up. all the instruments feel individual and sound separated. fireflies by owl city sounds lovely and all the strings sway in the centre while the various zaps and buzzes surround you. its really great for the price 1.2 treble and mids clean and clear. the bass doesnt overpower them and feels just right. the vocals come out clearly and all the instruments dont interfere with it drive home by steven wilson sounds great. 1.3 bass punchy and tight. i love how it fizzles in bonfire by knife party and how it reverberates in turn down for what by dj snake. breakin a sweatby skrillex, zedd sounded tight and i discovered how well produced it is lovers of tight bass, this is your product2. volume it gets really loud. so loud that i cant listen to it at the highest setting. but if thats your thing, then you should know that the highs get pretty shrill at the setting, but the bass is still pretty clean and loud3. anc anc is present, but wont drown everything out. its a great add on but if youre looking for a headphone to make all sounds around you zero, then this wont do that. if you need to drown out some noise while you listen to your tunes, this will do the trick 3.1 ambient sound mode the opposite of anc, it pulls in the outside noise to let you have a conversation. again, you cant blast tunes at high volume and still have a convo, but you can listen with lower volume near 25 volume and hear things around you. if the ambient sound also increased as i increased volume, it would have been amazing.4. calling did a couple of calls. with nonoise, the other person said i sounded great i took a couple of calls in a local grocery store was pretty loud and the other end had no issue hearing me.5. buttons the button placement is easy and i didnt feel any issue getting used to the controls. the simple manual explains everything in 2 mins, so read once and youre good to go. 5.1 to note the sound is best in dirac opteo mode. every time you turn it on, you have to double press the multi function button to turn it on. id have loved having it on by default. also every time i turn it on, it plays a 34 second tune, which could have been shorter. imagine hearing it every time you turn the thing on. ugh.6. connectivity once i connected it to my phone the first time, it connects to my phone within 12 seconds of turning the earphones on.7. battery it seems to last long ive been using them for about 4.5 hrs and its gone down about 20. cannot say anything more yet though. 7.1 when you take both the earphones out of your ears, it doesnt auto pause like some of the competitors. annoyed that this was missed, would have saved so much more battery if they did this.8. build quality i have a black version. its made with good quality plastic and didnt feel heavy around my neck. it doesnt have metal anywhere, and its quite simple. i think it looks decent.9. exercise need to test will update later.in summary, an easy recommendation. if you can overlook the small issues, theres a great sounding, featurepacked and long lasting device here at a great price 1010 would definetely recommend,first i was bit sceptical about the build quality but have to say its got a pretty sturdy material and decent quality buttons, bass is good, vocals are much clearer in crystal bionic mode, anc is working to a degree will definitely cancel out the noise of your celing fan but dont except any more than that, no issues with call enx is working upto its name, battery is sufficient around 1214 hours if you mix up the modes.. overall a decent all rounded neckband, jack of all and king of none.,all other things such as sound quality, battery backup are very good but multiple device pairing is implemented very poorly. if i connect with laptop and try to connect with phone at same time. it does not work many times. if headphones are connected to laptop and you close the laptop without shutting it down then you wont be able to connect with phone again unless and until you disconnect with laptop. this is a big bug. please fix this.,this boat 330 anc neckband is very good but needs improvement and fixes.pros nice sound quality while using crystal bionic sound, but its average on normal mode which feels a little more bassy and losses clarity at certain points. great build quality its anc ambience mode is good in this price range. its quite comfortable to wear for long sessions as per my ear fitting. it has dual pairing which is very good but its not very seamless and there is a small issue with dual pairing, e.g., while receiving a call on one device, the audiovideo being played at another device wont pause you have to manually pause instead there wont be any sound output through that device. its a little issue but it would have been great if the video gets paused while receiving a call on another device, as this is available on boat rockerz 335 and a few different boat neckbands.cons its range is very low considering bluetooth v5.2, i even have boat neckband with v5.0 which has better range. even a single wall coming in between 34ms can block the sound output. its battery life is average which needs charge every day if you use it for roughly 810 hours everyday with bionic crystal modeanc enabled. while using dual pairing sometimes there are sound drops and lags in between. and the sound gets high pitched and starts lagging sometimes if you switch quickly between devices. this happened on the replacement unit i received, maybe its not the case with your unit. sometimes no sound is received while playing audio from both devices. i dont know if its wrong with my unit or every unit.overall this is a good and considerable neckband under 2k if you want good bassrich sound quality, ancambience mode and descent battery life.but if your requirements mostly is dual pairing, then this is not for you. as i bought this considering dual pairing feature most importantly. but its not really seamless in between devices, but still its the best possible available feature in this price range or even under 5k but it needs improvements and fixes to make it more seamless and efficient.another problem with dual pairing is that the media doesnt gets paused on first device if theres a call on the second one, which is already there on boats few other neckbands, but then there is no mediapause feature on them. e.g., if audio is being played on 2 devices first device audio will get paused if audio is played on second device and viceversa.so do try it out by yourself. because its my personal experience with the neckband, maybe you get a better experience.thanks for reading. happy shopping,bought this one after using rockerz 255 pro for over 2 years now. comparing this with that, that one was ergonomically better, felt snug in ears.standalone review of this.1. noise cancellation is just alright, not too great, not too bad.2. sound quality is definitely great and excellent with the bionic sound feature. kudos on that part.3. bass quality is fairly good at this price point.4. holds charge for as long as advertised.5. overall bulky nature of the neckband puts you off and then the finish is poor too around the control buttons making it look very tacky cheap atleast on the funky grey one which i bought because it was priced lowest.conclusiongood product at a fair price i.e. nothing too great but nothing bad either.

value for money,working as expected,best at price,good built quality, functions need improvement,product is good but battery not as expected review content update after 8 monthsupdate 1 the problem mentioned in the earliest review is becoming more and more dire with time. now right earbud gets discharged in hour and a half, whereas left one keeps going, so reducing one star. will contact them for replacement and update here.update 2 called service center, they asked to bring it, but am lazy. i expected theyd replace at home. paid more attention towards the issue above. the stable situation is that just after full charge, right bud can go upto 4 hrs, but left one always goes for 3060mins more, and the difference is more if there is a standby of a day or two when the left one loses juice rapidly it seems, so i guess i can still use the buds but with certain restrictions will happily restore 5 stars if the issue stays stable for next 3 months.update after 6 monthsno change in quality, still the pack charges the buds like a boss. during this period, they were once kept in mouth by my infant nephew for over half an hour very dangerous, thankfully he couldnt swallow them, full of saliva and whatnot, and on another occasion i threw one of my earbuds on the floor with full force undisclosed depressing reason due to which the touch panel with the logo got detached, which i then reattached. after all this, buds are still rocking with same sound quality as on day 1. i think these are pretty darn sweet deals lack of volume control, etc. etc. is all forgiven. happy customer. although the issue of left earbud discharging earlier than right persists.original reviewusing for last 2 months.i am an audiophile and also an instrumentalist. but i hadnt used any tws yet, so wanted to dip my toes and didnt want to invest much, but also not something throwaway. so settled for boult no boat etc. due to their highly adultered sound signature, since i have previous experience with it. i like my music flat at studio quality. more recently, ive been using a low cost headphones with mindblowing performance oneodio pro50. go ahead and search it. it is really one of a gem for all those purist sound fans.coming to this tws.connectivity. right out of the box, only left one was working after connecting to my iphone. maybe right one didnt pair correctly to left. did that reset thing as suggested which also took some effort, but after that, both started working and since then, no issues. i am using both my phone and laptop linux. ofcourse you need to disconnect one to use another. but perfect connectivity now. i can move around in my 1300 sqft apt and no connection loss, which is great.call quality is decent, faced no disconnects yet, and the other party is also ok with my voice, but you cannot talk in a hushed voice, you always need to speak up in a medium volume to let the other party understand you.features. tapping is oddly sensitive, i mean it responds even if i am adjusting the bud, and not touching the central area, but surprisingly takes a decent tap punch to playpause. i can get used to that though. one thing, track aage peeche is ok. but these dont have anything which can control the volume. bummed on that.battery. decent backup. its been nearly 2 months. i use buds on an average of 23 hours daily, and i just had to charge the main case just 34 times. in an emergency i also used it to charge my iphone which it did really quickly. i was happy to see that. one weird thing to notice is that the right earbud always discharges more quickly than the left, infact i can use the left one 2030 mins more that the right. but anyways, i put them both in the case once any one of them starts to complain of low battery.sound quality.bass frequencies very decent bass. surprisingly great low bass songs like the humma song, i wanna love you sound pretty good, but a bit lacking in other frequencies of bass lut gaye by jubin doesnt sound that punchy as it should for a flat signature. overall for the most part, you should be fine.other frequencies ill review this from vantage point of studio quality signature. for mids, the spectrum is tilted towards bit of high bass but surprising absence of very specific high bass frequencies as mentioned above, but its bearable. for highs, initially i felt the presence a bit lacking, which takes away that warmth and fidelity from a few tracks, but after using it for a few days, i started feeling alright in that aspect, maybe some burn in god knows. also remembering that i paid just 1800 bucks for these i mostly will be using these while my walking and workout sessions, so i think my mind wont be nitpicking then. ill soon be upgrading though.overall, really a very decent purchase with good sound quality provided you can get these for under 2k. cheers,hey. .this one item has a built quality is like a stone..and also the working condition and sound quality it is marvelous, but only one problem is the noise cancellation that not working properly which means when we are in a crowded area while recording something or a call to another person the unwanted noises are coming they cannot hear properly our voice thats the only disadvantage on this one..,right buds not performs well, i am trying to change music to next but it still plays the same which should not happen according to manual,been using these for a month now. cant massively complain, the sound quality is decent enough may not be good enough for big music heads, not enough bass and provides good noise isolation. very impressed by the battery life with the charging case, and i use it every day. if you can snag it on a deal for 1500 bucks its a fantastic deal.,my only issue is, we cant change the connection to 2 devices by 1 click. every thing else is fine.,best at price. and require some button for operation.,call pick up rejection function, next song play function not working on single touch,product is good but battery not as expected <|>"

reviewsubscribexiaomi has garnered a welldeserved reputation for producing highquality smartphones with powerful specifications at affordable prices. the same applies to the companys diverse range of accessories as well. these are priced quite competitively and usually provide tremendous value for money.xiaomi recently launched two new pairs of budget earphones in the form of the mi earphones basic and mi earphones, and we have the latter for today. with a threebutton inline remote and mic, a kevlar fiber cable, metal sound chambers, and a rightangled plug, the mi earphones seem pretty promising on paper. we have put this pair through our tests to see whether that promise actually translates into realworld performance.xiaomi mi earphones design and comfortas expected from a pair of earphones in this price range, the mi earphones are made entirely out of plastic. that said, the build quality is actually quite impressive, with highquality tpe surrounds near the 3.5mm plug and

offflipkartbuyat just 14g, the earphones weigh next to nothing and are extremely comfortable. the housings are ergonomically shaped housings and angled at 45 degrees. they do not fall out of the ears easily, even during intense activities. the silicone tips are nothing to write home about, but that is expected considering the price.there is a threebutton inline remote with mic located right below the right earpiece, which can be used to answer calls, control music playback, and trigger the voice assistant on your smartphone. the buttons themselves are quite mushy and difficult to distinguish between by touch alone.xiaomi mi earphones performancexiaomi claim that the mi earphones feature a 3rd generation balanced damping system that creates a transparent sound, and metal sound chambers created via a 20step process. marketing fluff aside, how do the earphones really sound simply put surprisingly decent for earphones that cost less than a nice dinner for two.while most earphones in this price range have overinflated bass that dominates the rest of the frequency range, the bass response on the mi earphones is controlled and restrained. it doesnt overwhelm the sound signature or smother the highs. that said, bassheads will be left slightly wanting.its surprising to hear that highs are present and distinct in the sound mix, although they do get overpowering sometimes. the mids are slightly repressed, which is evident in vocalheavy genres such as blues. while the clarity on offer is decent for the price, songs with many layers of instrumentation do sound muffled and noisy. this is most evident in complex genres such as rock and metal in which the earphones sound harsh and the mids get buried by the treble and bass.,this earphone set is fantastic. and highly deserving of money. i used it for a while last in 2022, and now im buying it once more in 2023. in my perspective, the mi headset has good music and is easy to use.,good good,nice product.gentle bassno loud soundproduct quality is decentdont expect heavy music experience,its sometime uncomfortable but its fine i can adjust,seriously if you are a bass lover, then you can go for it.but its built quality is not good, it will damage automatically after 34 months,it is not suitable for rough uses.,got it for less than 300rs. not disappointted at all.if you compare it with other brands like boat, the sound quality isnt as good as the contemporaries. but for the price i paid, im not disappointed at all.the bass is solid. noise cancellation is average and the earphones are a little low on volume, couldve been louder.good value for money product for earphones under 300.,very good product as expected <|>"

go for a 1st time with zeb thunder pro, actually im a music lover and i expect more sound quality, bass thump and rich music feels , trust me below what i quote hereboat 900 is a budget segment wired type less than 800rs, its overall massive performance looks quite simple but gives extra bass overall worthand boat 400 900rs is discomfort because of over tight pressure in ears , i hope by long days its become loose,by the sound its gives a pinch more than extra bass than boat 900 , and looks smart, here sound is more and bass thump is very more..but here voice or somewhat looks bassy ,not suitable for online classes,...its only use for music loverboat 550 is around 1800rs its only suitable for online classes for voice no thump or bass at level, totally very mild sound with clear vocal ,dont expect bass or beat here and i met agreat issue is its over ear headphone and its make sweat my ear and make my body temp increase.now zeb thunder pro, 699rs for this price its a great product , classy look ,sd slot and so... but here some negative points also here,buttons or not sturdy some what loose and body parts are like head band are toy plastic, for music full volume is very loundness not lovely to like, make a shout punch in a ear painfull, bass is also very good but overall its always below tha boat products im not a hatter , but if u used a boat product u wont like it, same that if u use sony u wont like boat,. if u use no other brands and zebronics 1st time u become lover to this, still im surprise how they give this product for this price shocking aux type c under 700 is shocking bcoz if u go for boat type c product is 1700 abovezeb or not bad its more ok for this pricesound 45 heavy loud in full voume looks shouting inside ear , otherwise nicebass 3.75. not reach boat product , but u wont feel diff if u use for 3 more daysmusic sound vocals i cant separate in this productdurability 3.85 bcoz they used toy plastic in band, but however not easily breaks, compare to boat 450 its strong onlyoverall i look for a aux type c best bass effect, so at last above all are not reach my concern, now i ordered zeb bang pro699rsif it also sound loud thing, then i shutdown with boat 400 900rs segmentnote if i get boat 660 in initially , i wont go for these alllllll. bcoz unbeaten and full fil my all expect thanknu,sound quality is good, built quility is ok as per pricing . i got it for 600 rs totally worth it. its been more 10 days since i am using. its working totally fine.,sound and other qualities are doing well except ear cuffs are getting detached easily and no firm support for them,ponsthey are good for the price they come. sound is decent.battery life is long enough for 2 days not countinously.the wired features is a charm if battery goes dead. noise cancellation is also decent.coming to the bad points.build quality is a little cheap according to the price , the hinges shouldnt be used that much it will lose its grip.also the bluetooth is not that grt , if you are on a vehicle and connected your phone you will hardly hear any song.the connectivity is a issue. the dual connect is good but their is a latency of about 23 second when switching from one to another.thats all, you can buy this if your budget is less and as a student this is the best headphones at this price range.,sound great bass vocal and instrument seperation average to be expected like this for this priceconnectivity fast bt connection.bt disconnects when aux connectedcomfortable to wear since its over the earaverage build qualityoverall 45,i like this

and easy,good coverage,as money as goods,the signal reach could be better,overall is ok,product,class product from tplink a worthy investment. review content non returnable, so now using this as it is. bandwidth control is a must for this price range. model was archer c80.,great delivery from amaozn. it was easy to setup as a extender . signal is also good but not that great. it can cover 1 flat well . signal breaks if moving upstairs or downstairs. overall great purchase. must buy,need little better customer support,good,i expected much stronger signal 10 meter away. its okay working, but not as expected.,tp link is good product,good product,decided on buying this router from tplink after days of research, reading reviews and talking to many people regarding different models.was on a 20 mbps connection with a netgear n300 router since 2016 which used to suffice for moderate usage till now. however, with increase in the number of devices like smart tv, 2 ipads and a laptop etc, it necessitated an upgrade. also, considering the current workfromhome scenario which is bound to continue for the foreseeable future as well, the internet usage was being stretched to its limit and the trusted netgear router simply couldnt match up to the increased bandwidth demand.to capitalise on the current situation, our current isp came out with interesting fibre broadband plans and we opted for a 75 mbps connection. that in turn needed a new router to utilize its optimum potential. finally zeroed in on the tplink archer c80 after reading some horror stories of other available routers. was also tempted to buy the ax1500 considering theres barely any price difference, but then came across a few reviews which stated that wifi 6 is not entirely successfully implemented and might prove to be an hindrance to use with our current range of devices.order delivered by amazon within a day. full marks for the seamless delivery as always. prime has truly been a boon.installed the router today. installation via tether app was seamless. isp guy helped with the pppoe signin process and released the mac id which was bound to our old router. the whole process was done in 10 mins and we were online.the dual bands are truly a boon. have divided the devices at home equally between 2.4g and 5g as per usage. as the router is close to the tv unit, have connected it to 5g and also alternatively connected via the ethernet cable just in case.speed testsstarted off by streaming 4k content simultaneously on 2 devices connected to 5g. played seamlessly even with other devices like mobiles etc being connected.have attached a few pictures for reference. sitting near the router, 5g download speed is 77 mbps and upload is 75.4 mbps. 5g speed tested in the bedroom with a wall in between download 72.4 mbps and upload 74.9 mbps. 2.4g speed in the same room as the router is download 68.3 mbps and upload 79.2 mbps. this is quite surprising as a few reviews mentioned 5055 mbps will be the threshold for 2.4g. used to get a maximum of 45 mbps download on my old n300. speed test via the ethernet cable provided in thr box connected to the tv download 78 mbps and upload 75 mbps.couldnt have asked for more really. this seems to be totally ideal.build quality of the device is decent and the antennas seem well enough to do the job, however would have preferred that they were placed like other tplink models like the archer a6, so it would have been easier to move them in preferred directions.the led lights are a little weirdly placed and not bright enough. maybe im used to the prominent lights on my old router. these are a blinkandmiss sort and you have to bend a little to check in case theres an issue. one big element missing in this device is a usb port which is absolutely essential in todays age and expected to be included for this price range. wonder whats the reason behind giving it a miss.i have sealed the extra lan ports with tape to protect from dust or moisture. its a good practice. the outer design of the router is quite sophisticated and stylish, however im a little worried of dust accumulating in the intricate design on the top portion.functionally though, this seems to be a real good offering from tplink. hope this device lives up to expectations in coming days. allinall, seems to be a worthy investment for the next few years, considering an internet plan upgrade, if any.hope i touched upon major points which might help other interested consumers in making a choice. this product is recommended <|>"

..,superb review content                     technical specificationsheres the technical information of boat bassheads 225 inear headphones. the information provided below is as per the manufacturer. boat bassheads 225 have a frequency range of 20 hz to 20 khz. it features 10 mm drivers. rated impedance of 16 ohms. comes with 1.2 meter flat tangle free cable. 3.5 mm goldplated lshaped audio jack 90 degrees. sensitivity 98 db3 db.                    built quality designi was not expecting metal built at this price range but to my surprise, boat bassheads 225 are fully made up of metal. it has a diagonal gridlike texture on the buds which feels amazing on touch. the metal construction gives boat bassheads 225 a premium feel attractive appearance. the cable used by boat on bassheads 225 is flat with rubberized coating, it is a tanglefree cable does its job well by decreasing the chances of the cable tangling. despite the metal construction, boat bassheads 225 are very lightweight comes with a microphone lshaped 3.5 mm audio jack which is again made up of metal. overall the built quality is excellent for the price seems very durable. the ear buds have proper l r labels and are clearly visible. boat bassheads 225 comes with medium sized silicone tips already installed outofthebox.           audio qualityto ensure that i can test the bassheads 225 at their uppermost limit, i used highquality mp3 files of 320 kbps lossless audio formats like flac wav. for smartphone listening, i used poweramp music player tweaked settings every now and then to see their extreme capability. for the computer, i used itunes player vlc audio player. i also tested these earphones on apple ipod, iphone sony mp3 player. all this went for more than 10 days finally, i had my results.boat bassheads 225 promised what they claimed, they really are very bassy as compared to others. during my tests with them, i found that the audio quality is very good for the price, the bass output is amazing and overpowers the vocals by default, by tweaking the equalizer settings a bit, i saw a good level of improvement in the vocals, they were clearer than before but overall average. the treble was again very good, the highfrequency sounds were clear pleasant to ears. the mids were average but overall the audio experience on boat bassheads 225 was decent. when listening to music, the overall sound quality is amazing, you can easily distinguish between different instruments sounds which is a good thing for extra bassy headphones.                      noise isolation comfortwhen it comes to noise isolation, boat bassheads 225 are very good at it, they come with medium sized ear tip preinstalled which seemed perfect for my ears, once the earphones are on, i wasnt able to hear outside noise, they sealed my ears completely delivered an immersive experience. make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation comfort. overall boat bassheads 225 are comfortable but they seem a bit stiff somewhat awkward when used for longer periods. since the housing is made up of metal, you may find them popping out every now then when used during running, jogging or any other sport or physical activity, this didnt happen as often for me but for a friend, they keep popping out every now then while running maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it, an easy solution to this will be using the ear hooks which came along with it. when using bassheads 225 with ear hooks, they were a bit uncomfortable initially, but as i got used to them, they were fine, plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep a hold on them.flat cable microphonethe cable is great, i personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with a perfect flat cable which is tangle free comes with a rubberized coating. the cable does its job well. the microphone is again exceptionally good, it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise. during calls, the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance. there is one button on the microphone which helps to pick upreject calls on the go, without taking your phone out. it can also be used to control music, which is again a good to see in a budget friendly earphone like boat bassheads 225.                    warranty priceboat bassheads 225 comes with standard one year warranty, so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe, in case you need it for warranty.             final thoughtsive personally used boat bassheads 225 inear headphones for more than two weeks average daily two hours of listening before writing this review and im pretty much impressed with them. im personally a fan of extra bass iems and currently, my primary iem is sony mdrxb50ap which again falls under extra bass category. comparing sony mdrxb50ap with boat bassheads 225 will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them, but i would still like to add that bassheads 225 did a great job and didnt disappoint me, obviously it doesnt stand a chance in front of sony mdrxb50ap but still looking at the price of bassheads 225 the quality they offer, i was really very impressed.boat bassheads 225 turned out to be exceptional earphones, after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices music players, i can say that theyre amazing for the price, a pure steal deal. the bass output is amazing and is very intense, ill recommend using correct size ear tips good quality music player like poweramp android for better bass output. the treble is good vocals are average, somewhere i feel that bass overpowers the vocals, but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results. the mids are again average.my rating 4 out of 5                    the verdicttaking everything into account, overall im very impressed with boat bassheads 225. the built quality is amazing, the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass good overall soundstage. tweaking the equalizer a bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals, mids highs. overall the vocal highs are good mids are average but still good for the price. ill recommend these iems to bass lovers budgetconscious people who are looking for high quality durable earphones at a reasonable price. genres like edm, rock, hiphop sound really great on them. boat bassheads 225 justify the price they come for, the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price range.hope i helped you.thanks,yes, so you have heard that this is the best wired earphone under 500. yes you can consider it to buy. but there are few points to remember before buy. from my user experience i can tell you this1. this is not comfortable at all. it slips from ear mostly. you feel pain in ear after using it.2. never buy this for online class, as it is not possible to wear it 68 hours straightly.3. after switching from boat basshead 172, i feel that the bass is not good as the previous one. i dont know why. it should be better.4. sound dont explode or go outside of the buds to 50 as it go outside on boat 510 headphone, so its good.5. feeling heavier on ears. not as comfortable as realme buds 2. though both are metal build. for balance sound you can buy realme buds 2.6. buy it only to listen music, not for too long time. do not consider it for online class and long time wear session. hope it helped you. its just my opinion from using boat 225, boat 172, boat 510, realme buds 2, mi basic.,its a very good product but i dont recommend buying this because earpiece is heavy and you need to keep adjusting it and pushing it inside whenever you move your head, they will fall off easily with the slightest motion, you will soon find it annoying. sound quality, build quality everything is good but earphones falling off ears will irritate you.,raat me apne babu se dhere dherebaat krne pr v aacha se sunae deta h,i purchased the product a year ago.it worked fine.i love the sound quality.but you may not expect it to work after a year.my headphone doesnt work now properly .my warranty get expired so ,i have to buy a new one.,good buy but 1 side earphone stopped after 67 month,sound quality is above average .. but i got 1.5 years old manufactured ear phones.. build quality is as per cost . cant

and getting pain,must buy this for normal use,noisy and not ergonomic,great product,well suited for ordinary and official usage.,nice product review content edit this doesnt change my review actually, it probably makes it lean even heavier towards the 4 star than 3 star rating but i actually sat on the keyboard while it was on my chair im an absolute unit of a dude weighing 120kg and the keyboard wasnt affected at all. im genuinely surprised.first of all, id give this a 3.55 instead of the 4 but i rounded it up instead of down because theres more to like than dislike.product was delivered promptly but the packaging was in rough shape. when i unpacked it, the keyboard had three missing keys iirc it was left alt, z and the windows keys. i turned over the box and dumped everything and voila the missing keys fell out. not off to a great start but i slapped those keys on which was very straightforward meaning that replacing keycaps in the future will be relatively easy and plugged in the receiver to my laptop. no setup or 3rd party software necessary, it just started working instantly. pretty seamless.i only use the keyboard when i connect my laptop to my tv and im sitting at a distance, i use my laptops keyboard otherwise. i absolutely love the keyboard. i was expecting it to feel wonky and cheap but it actually feels decent. its not super premium but its much better than what i was expecting for the price. it has flip stands on the back to raise it and an onoff switch if you want to conserve battery. the keys themselves are full sized, and as someone with larger hands, i really appreciate it. the curve around the space bar looks cool but i dont think it adds anything ergonomically. the typing experience is nice, the keys have enough feedback to them not mechanical levels obviously, but still satisfying enough. the caps lock key has a little raised bit to it so you can feel it without looking at it and dont accidentally hit it while typing, neat little addition. the shortcutmedia keys on top all work fine with windows 11. theres not much else to say about the keyboard. it should be more than sufficient for everyday officebrowsingschool tasks and will be good and comfy for people who type a lot. do not buy this expecting a gaming level keyboard with antighosting, etc or buy it expecting to have the durability of a true mechanical keyboard. i was initially going to mark it down for not having any backlight at all but given the budget, thats understandable and acceptable. overall, i very much like the keyboard and find it to be above par for what you pay.the mouse, on the other hand no pun intended, is mediocre at best. the build quality is not good it does not feel good when you use either of the click buttons, you can feel the inner mechanisms groaning, like its gonna fall apart at any time. the mouse also starts lagging randomly. the lag only lasts a couple of seconds but it occurs enough to be an annoyance. also, it just doesnt feel good in your palm. i have an amazon basics mouse that i purchased while i was in the us for 7 520rs and that thing feels so much sturdier and better built than this. it also has no lagging issues and the clicks feel smooth even after a few years of use.as an overall package, i would say its decent for the price. there are lots of other sets in this price range and i picked this literally because of the logitech branding since i own a few other logitech products and enjoy them a lot. the keyboard is doing all the heavy lifting here and carrying its mouse friend. i hope they improve the mouse going forward because then, this would be the best combo in this range. as it stands right now, its fairly indistinguishable from its competitors.recommended for people looking for an affordable wireless set for everyday computer work and people who type a lot.not recommended for gaming or any form of power users. it might work for single player games like city builders, grand strategy, rtses, etc but i would not recommend it for any form of shooters, especially online. the mouse simply isnt up to task.,,the keyboard is good and working nice. for me the mouse is too small and not able to use properly and getting pain after using for very less time only. it will be good if the mouse is in regular size. also the mouse is lagging a bit even after changing the settings.,i using this product since one year not any problem found.even battery cell not change,i dont really know if its worth the cost or not. but, i mainly prefer silent typing and mouse clicks. ergonomic is also a must as i use these for long hours.currently, i use logitech m590 mouse which is really awesome and makes almost no noise at all.,great product,i have been using this product for 2years. its battery is great, still running. the keys could get hard with time, therefore i had to use wd40 to lubricate them. after 2years, some random keys have stopped working, such del, semicolon, numpad3. the mouses right click isnt functioning anymore. the left click has irritating double click issue. so not suited for fps games. speed and connection is adequate, no lag noticed. the keyboard collects a lot of dust so better to cover it. ergonomics are great no issue with that. if youre looking for a longer size keyboard for approx. 2years of proper functioning for daily or official use, then it is a good purchase. mouse is small and comfortable, even for left handed people. keep in mind the keys will become stiff over time.,i purchased it for my personal use , which includes mostly working, it has good connectivity both for keyboard and mouse . i have not faced any issue with it. i have not tested its performanace. <|>"

online classes,very noise,average quality,nice experience in this headphone review content stopped working after a month of use. dont waste your money on this product,everything is best but build quality is avg,lets get directly into the pros cons sry it will be a long review coz the review have to be useful for everyone who plans to buy this.pros the price, given to this price bracket its the best one i can suggest from the built quality to the audio quality its superior for the price 499 i got for this price tagthen the comfort, everybody complaining about the earpads i dont know why, if your going for over the ear type u have to be known that u cant wear it all day long the most expensive products also tend to warm your ears and get a little uncomfortable, so if its not preffered u can go for earphones or earbuds. as i bought multiple ober the ear headphones there will be rought cloth like texture that will irritate your ears, but this one has soft cushion like material, im really comfortable with this one.and next the audio quality, i have previosuly owned boult inear earphones so i know the bass quality and vocal quality, so i booked this without even thinking twice, and it has delivered what it can. the best part is im really comfortable in this one than my inear earphones, the sound is even better and you dont get high volume levels like those local cheap products on the markets. but the bass and clarity will give you some extra feel, especially the bass.. its really engaging, if ur a bass lover go for it.then the quality, i know the boult for sometime but for over the ear headphones at this price point i was little skeptical about the build quality before the delivery and it suprised me, dont think that build quality is extraordinary like sennheiser or sony coz ur not paying that much for this, so for this price its so good, even better than the boat headphones which is slightly high in the price tag.now cons little skeptical about the warranty, because when i gone to register this and both while i was registered my boult inear earphones, they didnt asked for invoice slips and no serial number is asked, then how can they proceed if we call for the warranty claims... but hopefully i think this will last long as seeing the quality. next is the cable quality, i didnt complaining about it, but they mentioned in amazon as its an kevlar cable, so i expected a lott but its a normal cable bt its sturdy enough. i didnt check the mic on it, i make a call on this, the other person was able to understand me, but i dont know hows the quality.to help you guys, i have metioned every aspect in detailed manner so it can helpful for people who spend their valuable money coz every single rupee counts..have a nice and safe shopping. bye,achhi product he,got the product delivered unharmed in 6 days.i got it for 499.this is the best branded product in this price range.sound quality is pretty good considering the price.bass is good but the loudness is a bit low, you have to listen them above the 50 level of your mobile.clearity is very good.i bought them for online lectures and they worked great for the purpose.ear cups are comfortable and reduces much background noise, besides they arent known for passive noise cancellation.the wire attached to the ear cups is a bit delicate and may break if pulled forcefully so you have to handle it carefully.i have attached a pic with side by side comparison of my old boat rockerz 400 which i bought for 999 in 2018 and they lasted for a very long duration of 4 years.the boult audio q2 looks a bit delicate as compared to boat rockerz, but dont forget theres a double price difference between them.lets see how long it goes....summing up this is the best product in this price segment 500. just go for it if you get the same.,noise level is so high i couldnt listen more than 5 minutes.. so i like to choose another brand please refund for this product,quality not as expected

title, to explore our other models. review title not a disappointment, but can be better,it is not a bad idea to spend your money on this smart watch,nice quality,display is awsome,sleep tracking review content original 3rd jan 2021 this is my first smartwatch. i have bought a couple of honor fitness bands earlier for family, but this is my personal first. i have been keenly following the smartwatch space for the last 10 months or so and im aware of most of the products in the budget range. while i can afford a slightly more expensive one gts2gtr2 or honor gt2 pro, oppo watch, fitbit etc with calling feature, i wanted to get the feel of a smartwatch in the budget range first. i gave a lot of thought and finally bought this one as it included gps and amazon alexa yet to be included, but must be available through an ota update. id have loved to buy amazfit bip u pro as it has almost the same features with an lcd display has gps and alexa in the global version named amazfit pop pro. it still isnt released in india.coming to the watchs performance, the typical features i tried today first day are heart rate hr, spo2, stress monitoring and gps. i have a pulse oximeter from dr. trust at home and so i could compare the hr and spo2. the numbers on the watch arent very accurate to my surprise heart rate variation by 510 bpm and spo2 percentage off by 10 points at times . but i still feel its more to do with calibration and the way these numbers are measured than inaccuracy of the hardware etc. gps was a breeze as i walked on the terrace of my rural town house. it wont surprise me if i dont get the same performance in a metro city with a lot of high rise apartments etc. the compass worked fine when i compared it with my phone. music controls worked fine, bluetooth data transfer or sync was good. i couldnt control the phone camera as i couldnt get that feature to work refer to image and help me if you can. i didnt face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notifications. the readability on the watch screen has been really good. tried a couple of workouts. while the step count seems to be fine, not sure of the accuracy of the stats on other workout modes.to conclude, i wouldnt say that this watch is a disappointment, but it needs improvements on the accuracy of the fitness stats. probably i should give it more time, but fitness brands have done better in terms of accuracy at least the honor bands ive seen. eagerly waiting for alexa update as im curious what all it can do.i would love to update my review after using the watch for few more days. lets see.update 8th jan 2021 the battery is a clear disappointment as many other users pointed out. im hardly getting it for 3.5 days with always on display and an occasional workout. limited watch faces, both on device 4 and the app 57. not many out of these 57 do justice to the good display. waterproof nature of the device is good. i didnt dip it in water, but it got wet when i was bathing my kids and it seems to have a waterproof coating which was in action. i got the camera shutter to work. i hope amazfit provides updates to fix battery drain and enable alexa. notifications didnt have an issue, but could not clear individual items clear all worked,review of amazfit gts 2 mini smart watch 2021 modelhello everyone . since the new model of amazfit gts2 mini arrived , i am going to review the old model of itprosdisplay 1.55 inch amoled display , really good look . prosbattery coming with 220 mah , from 100 percent to 13 percent it takes 10 days to drain and it was expected to last 1 day longer normal use . but if you are a light user ,it can last it for 14 days . proip rating ip 68 water resistant which is cool .proheartbeat sensor it has heartbeat sensor and it is real , but it may not show real accuracy at all the time . but it performs good procomfortness it is really comfortable wearing this watch and the band is silicone material. prowork out modes there are nearly 70 workout modes and i tested out some , since it is built in gps , it works nearly accurate but the measure is not that much accurate but it works well. procan track stresshas pai feature to progress your workout with better experiencealexa assistant but need phone connection to activate this has other modes like breathing ,menstrual cycle tracking,todolist , inbuilt alarm ,pomodoro timer ,sleep tracker ,timer , in built compass , camera remote ,find the phone , controlling music etc.notification system you can get notifications .call control system you can accept or reject calls , but you cannot able to talk through watch.consbuild quality it is told that this watch is completly aluminium frame but it is quite disappointing that only half frame is gun metal aluminium . and half is poly carbonate con .watch faces the inbuilt watch faces are quite depressing at initial impressions but there are some watch faces that are really good . conspo2 i dont know how much accurate it is , but coming to technical part , the sensors are failing most of the times . sometimes cannot able to sync workout history .converdict it is not a bad idea to spend money for this watch due to immense features and real sensors but you should compromise on sensors efficiency and build quality .,the incoming call notification disconnects if youre away from the watch even though other notifications are displayed in the watch. i have accidentally hit the display of the watch while walking in walls and steel doors, even though its not damaged. water resistance is good. i used to wash dishes wearing it. no use of alexa.i think its a good buy after 2 months of usage,all over amazfit gts2 mini new version is good but price is high and also calling features not available that is the biggest drawback. apart for this other things are really nice.,sleep tracking is fantastic but there is some bug after the update is that the sleep traking track itself even we not wear the watch.rather all thing are fantastic and battery life is 7 day in normal uses <|>"

mode supports ap mode totransformyour wiredconnection into the wireless networkeasy setup set up your wifi in minutes with the tplink tether app. review title disappointed review after 1 year 3 months of usage,good product and received latest v4,good budget gigabit router with beamforming and multiple options in firmware,range is issue for 5g every where,value for money,go for it,super ,signal, support, install review content i really liked this router for a smallish space. the coverage never dropped and was mostly consistent.however it suddenly developed some snag and stopped connecting to the internet. apparently the ethernet port got damaged somehow. i tried calling tp link service center numbers and realised how bad their service is. its the first time in my life that a router has broken and that too after just over a years usage. and to make it worse theres dismal after sales service.i tried to buy a replacement from tp link but that router came with problems as the connection wasnt stable. i think ill finally look towards other router makers and avoid tplink product until maybe they start caring more for their costumers. hopefully ill find a good maker .,good router,after researching lot i settled on tp link a6,i was looking for better range router, this router really worth the price. dual band, guest wifi. i upgraded from tenda n301, and performance is really good.range for 5gz is not that good as 2.5gz but which is accepted and no other routers in this range can provide better than this.,i was using tenda ac 10 router since 2019 for 100mbps connection from local isp mach1 broadband, mumbai. most of devices 5 mobiles, 4 laptops, 1 firestick at my home work on 5ghz except 1 cctv camera. range of tenda ac 10 was good and used digisol ac750 repeater for farthest room of my 2 bhk home.in recent lightning strike in mumbai, power adapter of tenda ac10 got burned out and performance issues creeped in with replacement adapter. i was searching for router with good range and speed within my budget. i tried 2 routers mercusys ac1900 mr50g tp archer c80 ac1900 before this. both routers didnt meet my expectation. range and speed of these 2 routers were poor than my earlier tenda ac10. amazon accepted returns without a single question. thumbs up to amazon.after some more research, i zeroed on tp link archer a6 c6. as per comparison on tp link website both are identical routers. after doing some more research on blogs and reviews, i found that archer a6 is the latest model and had slightly better processor both from qualcomm. hence purchased archer a6. feature of onemesh is added advantage for adding onemesh repeaters in future. separate wifi ssid with same strength on both 2.4 5 ghz as unnamed wifi can be seen on wifi analyser, as per tp link support page, this is dedicated wifi link for onemesh repeaters.now for router, router is same as tenda ac10 for coverage, it can not cover farthest room in 2bhk on 5ghz. 2.4 ghz band can cover 2bhk house, but speed is around 30 mbps on 100 mbps plan. however, speed on archer a6 is better that tenda ac10. im getting 90 mbps upload and download consistently on devices 515 feet apart in 5ghz. tp link archer a6 is better than costlier ac1900 routers. just for info, i received us version v2 of router instead of eu version mentioned on tp link india website. hence, firmware on tp link india website will not match with device firmware. however, this device has auto update option directly from internet. also, router can be managed by tplink tether app remotely on internet even tough not connected on same wifi by login using tp link account on both router and tether app.by trying so many routers, i understood that 5ghz range will be week even with costliest router. instead of using digisol ac750 repeater, i installed my old tenda ac10 in repeater mode for 5ghz 2.4 ghz disabled. now my complete home is covered by 5ghz signal. in the farthest room i receive download upload speed of around 75 mbps.i also tried old tp link archer c50 which i had purchased when abroad, performance is not good in terms of speed and range as it lacks gigabit ports, beamforming mumimo.my isp has connected my link on gigabit port of their switch in my society. however, cabling is only 2 pair cat 5e which supports max 100 mbps full duplex. i will try to get cabling changed to either 4 pair cat 5e or cat6 from isp and check the performance. i will update review after cabling change.so in the nutshell i would recommend to go for router with gigabit ports, beamforming mumimo even if your internet speed is less than 100mbps as it is future proof. tp lnk archer a6 is good router meeting all requirement within the budget.hope this review is useful in search of good futureproof router.edit 1my isp tried to replace my connection to ftth and this router was connected to fiber onu using gigabit port. it worked only for 15 mins. max speed was 230 mbps. isp was not able to resolve the ftth issue and changed cable to 4 pair cat5e, which supports gigabit transmission. now net speed is around 160 mbps. my internet plan is 100 mbps. im happy with the speed. i have asked isp to change my connection to ftth at last. tenda ac10 is now working as wired repeater connected on gigabit port of archer a6 using cat5e cable. now complete home received stable wifi of 160 mbps on 5ghz band.i will update once again when ftth connection is successful.,good product till now 1 month,i am very satisfied.,i am really satisfied with this product as earlier my phone is keep getting wifi disconnected and i used to reconnect it and the same way vpn is keep getting reconnecting in my laptop hence my teams call used to disconnect during the meeting.. now i am happy with this product where my vpn is not reconnecting even internet goes down and if any flatuations in the network as well.. finally i am not seeing any issue with this router.. it is helping me during work from home ,please go ahead,its easy to use, easy to install , more function to control the router <|>"

ergonomic keyboard.,the best keyboard for a mac environment review content so i got this keybaord a few days ago and it came in a package that can be best described as being mauled by a bear. it was totally beaten up and inside the batteries of the keyboard ha come loose alsothough i could just pop it back in no problem. thankfully it works fine, i tested all the keys and they are functional so lets get to the meat of the subject, or paneer if youre vegetariani think this keyboards performance will vary according to your use case. for me the primary objective was to get an android compatable keybaord since i had shifted the majority of my wokrload from my laptop to my tablet. i checked the internet and settled on this little guy becaue of teh glowing reviews and from my friend who had the ink variant of the keyboard. i bought it along with the logitech pebble m350 wireless mouse since it came in a bundle and honestly i dont regret it. both of them fir very well into my work type and theyve made my life a lot more easier.this is of course a bluetooth keyboard and it does not have any wireless dongles hidden away in the chassei checked. the keyboard has no backlighting as expected from a wireless eyboard that runs on regular pen torch batteries, and from my friends experience this battery will last you a long time. the major feature of this wireless keyboard over the other brands in teh market is the ability to switch between 3 bluetooth capable devices with the press of a button. now i personally thought that i wouldnt be using this feature all that much since i was plaaning on using this keyboard for my android tablet. but then i realised that, i could set up my laptop as a second device and switch between my tablet and laptop without any issues making it easier to type out papers on my laptop and responding to texts, emails on my android tablet at the same time. nowadays i cant stop using this feature since i have my phone, tablet and laptop paired to this keybaord and my productivity has become much more efficent. it is honestly very neat.the keys are rounded which is much more pleasant to type on than lets say square keys, and the slight inclination of the keyboard serves as good angle that reduces finger fatigue while typing. this comes with no wrist rest so people who have had hand injuries should either look for another keyboard or buy the wrist rest seperately. teh keys are membrane keys and they feel a bit stiff in my honest opinion, but nonetheless it has a good feedback and the typing experience is very comfortable. it does not have a number pad as you migth have seen from the product images, so if you are someone that crunches a lot of numbers ine excel you might want to skip this keyboard.the latency is quite low from my perspective, i dont think they have that crispy logitech lightspeed tech built into it though, but you wont be using this for gaming, and if you are planning to then please dont. this keyboard performs horribly in gaming, and i mean its terrible. this is a keybaord targeted at people who do a lot of typing across multiple devices and it is built with portability in mind. if i am ambitious enough i can probably stuff this keyboard into my pocket, because of how small it is. like my friends say i have small hands, well this keyboard was probably designed for a rat because my hands are huge compared to this keybaord. sometimes while i am resting my hand on the homerow my ring finger accidentally presses one of teh mushy media buttons at the top and everything i am doing goes into stasis. but that is more of a me problem than a problem with this keyboard. it does come with arrow keys which is very surprising. they actually managed to squeeze it in.i mean thats pretty much it for this keybaord. dont buy it for rs.3k i suggest waiting for a discount because this thing is certainly not worth that much. i would say this is like a rs.1.4k keyboard but thats just my opinion. if you are buying this for the android experience then i suggets buying it bunded with the mouse. because both of them kind of complete each other. with that being said im going to conclude my review.,mouse came turned on. apart from that no issues discovered till now, it going good.,its one of the best budget keyboards i have ever used.. the membrane keys are very soft and easy to click not lift off weight easy on the fingers its been around 1yr since i bought this keyboard and iam using it ever since no issues so far and iam highly satisfied with my purchase definitely gonna recommend it . very good typing experience so far, caps lock indicatorheight isnt adjustableno backlight,the key travel is very very less, please keep that in mind. otherwise a decent product at the price range.,i bought this in combination with a logitech pebble m350 bluetooth mouse for the sole purpose of using it with my ipad. it has made my tasks easier and with recent ipados updates, there are tons of shortcuts that make ipad experience more productive. since i was going for a retrolooking device, i chose sand color. makes me nostalgic about the old school computer devices that had similar finish. connectivity is fast. you just switch it on and its connected to your primary device in a matter of seconds, even less. they keys are not silent but at the same time not loud enough to disturb your environment.you can connect upto 3 devices and switch between them seamlessly with the push of a button. im also using the setup for gaming. will maybe update later about that experience.final comments ergonomic, economic, portable and lovely recommend buy for all who need to get work done fast.,this keyboard is awesome , it has a flawless connectivity and a great size for portability . just that it is not fitted with a lift at the back and i miss the backlight design , but it is a value for money product . works flawlessly with mac as well as windows. <|>"

use,good printer,good,good for occasional printing. extremely easy to use review content i bought this item in august 2022, and the delivery and packaging was as good and sturdy as ive come to expect from amazon. using the printer from my macbook is a breeze over wifi, although printing over wifi from android requires some poorly designed app from canon and has no direct support.the only couple of issues i faced with this printer were during setup.1. scanning the qr code for the setup guide didnt actually lead to much of a guide, rather a boilerplate page. i would only much later find out the way from that page to the actual guide. canon could do a better job of surfacing the online guide, as the image clarity in the included hard copy is quite poor.2. installation of cartridges seemed to take forever i must have removed and reinserted them almost 5 times before they were properly detected. no error messages showed up, and i didnt know if i had recieved a faulty product, or if i was doing something wrong.3. never having owned a printer, and always using either copy shops or the huge laser printers at work, i ended up making a mistake in setting up the paper tray, leading to a jam at the first print itself. thankfully it was straightforward to open up the printer from the back side and remove the torn pieces. canon could do a better job of demonstrating how to set up the paper sheets clearer access to the online guide mightve helped here.except for the these minor concerns in setup, im enjoying using this printer surprisingly, since printers alongside projectors are usually the worst items ever developed by the electronics industry. ive used all the features so far print colored, double sided, scan and copy and not faced any issues with quality, wifi or the cartridges. information on the number of color and blackandwhite sheets from the initial set of cartridges to be added when i run out,good scanner printer,installation procedure is very simple and priter quality is high. i had a xerox copier, but istallation of scanner option could not complete.,if you are purchasing it for your home use, dont look any further. it has got all the functions youll find in a 2030k worth printers. all in one includes print, scan, copy and fax as well, colour, adf, duplex printing, wifi. you download the app in ur phone and give print commands via mobile itself. only two issue that i faced, firstly the print qualitywhich ill speak to the service center and secondly is the total quantity of color prints. i have only taken out couple of color printouts bad already the level of ink is 90. i guess ill have to purchase a larger cartridge.,very good printer. sometimes back to back printing cases paper blockage. but overall very happy,gud printer but printing cost is expensive. in this price range features are very nice.,i got this printer ion 02nov2022, after 15days of usage ..im unable to print as it is showing color black ink is low ..i have print less than 50pages ...and in description they told that 400pages yield which is totally wrong.,cannon e4570.this was launched as a successor for e4270 i searched everywhere but couldnt find a credible source to explain the differences between the two. i researched extensively before purchase to find a printer which will fullfil the following criteria for me wifi enabled so that we can print with smartphone without opening the laptop, clear color print decent for childs homework, photo quality not required and cheap to run. e4270 seem to fit all the criteria, so i ordered this. even the canon authorised showroom didnt have e4570 in stock, so ordered the e4570 off amazon.summary fullfills top two criteria. though is a little expensive if you do more than the occasional print.delivery was 3 days earlier than the delivery date shown on amazon, so that was great. it was just the printer box, with no outer packing. the box was sealed with cello tape, and not sealed, so i suspect it had been opened at some point. thankfully, all the components were there, and the seal on the printer and cartridges were intact, so i was ok with the delivery.setup was smooth on both my smartphone and laptop over wifi. i never had to use the usb cable. setup was through the canon app on phone and the canon website link for both given in manual, which guides step by step on how to setup. i did not face any challenges and the setup and printing has been smooth from all devices.color prints are a bit faded on plain paper 75gsm. this might be a function of the paper and not the printer. the blackwhite prints are crisp and sharp. the print speed is decent.the only negative is the amount of ink consumption. while the box says 180 color prints and 300 bw, both my cartridges are showing at 80 after 4 color print and around 30 bw. specially for color prints, the printer tends to drop the cartridge level by a notch after just 23 prints. i suspect the color cartridge will not last longer that 3040 full color pages. refilling the cartridges a few times is of course an option, but it is messy and requires practice. this is fine for me as i need color prints very rarely.a special mention for the adf and duplex printing. both the features are extremely useful. duplex printing is especially unique in this price range, and comes in very handy while printing larger documents.overall, i am happy with my purchase after couple of weeks of usage. i will update the review if i run into any issues. <|>"

like clones of each other. it was therefore with some excitement that i bought this havells model that had at least three novel features an autocutoff facility, a temperature control knob, and a protective plastic cover for that part of the heater users could come into accidental contact with. but quite a bit of my excitement drained away when the heater arrived. i couldnt use it straightaway because it has a cord thats barely a metre long, and it just couldnt reach the 16a socket it needs to be plugged into. such heavyduty sockets are normally positioned high in most bathrooms, so that they are easily accessible to any storage waterheaters that may be installed. havells should have made allowances for this and added at least another footandahalf to the cord length. for a largescale manufacturer, this extra length would have made little difference to the production cost. the product, anyway, is priced a couple of hundred rupees more than other 1500w heaters the mrp being even higher, at rs1000.in my case, therefore, the heater had to be accessorized before it could be used i had to buy a stool that would raise the the bucket off the floor, and thus compensate for the shortness of the cord. and no, it cant be any stool lying around in your home it has to be a stool of a certain height, about 14 inches for me. any taller, and the bucket cant be accommodated under the tap any shorter, and you begin cursing havells again for their miserliness with the cord. the stool took two days to arrive, and i inaugurated the heater a full four days after it was delivered. thank god my old immersion heater was still usable, in spite of its heavily calcified condition.there is yet another problem with this heater though it helpfully allows you to choose between three temperature settings, you dont know what value each setting corresponds to. what does high temperature mean 60 degrees celsius seventy i found out the hard way when i set the temperature high, and the heater wouldnt switch itself off for 15 minutes, which is five minutes longer than the time my old heater takes to heat up some 20 litres of water. and by then, the water had turned scaldingly hot. i tried the medium setting the next day, and again had the nasty experience of having to deal with extra hot water. perhaps the right setting is low then. im not sure. neither the product literature that came with the heater nor the havells website has any information that will help you choose the right setting, and stop you burning yourself.so both the innovative features of this heater that made me buy it the variable heat setting and the autocutoff ultimately turned out to be quite useless. i still have to depend on my instinct, and on my experience with my old featureless heater, and manually turn the heater off when i think its done its job.i have a question for other users of this product, or for the manufacturer can the temperature be set to inbetween values, something between low and medium, for instance. the way the controlling knob is marked, with several lines between the presets, suggests this is possible. or maybe thats yet another useless feature of this fancy heater. more trialanderror but should such a basic piece of equipment be so difficult to useupdateafter a weeks use of this heater, id like to add a word of caution for the benefit of other buyers and users. since the heater has its own indicator light, which switches off at the set temperature, you may forget to switch the socket switch off, particularly if the switch is away from the socket, as in some contemporary bathrooms that have all switches bunched together at the bathroom door. if you forget to switch the socket off, and, in the meantime, have removed the heater from the bucket, it will begin to heat up again once the temperature has fallen below the set value. this dryheating will damage both the heater and wall, if youve hung the heater up. but, more significantly, it will also be extremely hazardous if your body is wet, and theres no one around to switch the socket off for you. this happened to me twice. call me dumb, if you want to, but please be careful.,the product is good and does its work. i didnt find any use of the thermostat feature as though it turns off automatically the low temper in itself is very hot. it take just 5 to 7 mins to get the water be bath ready. further the product says that ilthe rod should not touch the bucket but the product handle is made in such a way that it touches, but that causes no trouble. its not shock proof so dont check temperature of water with it turned on.,product received with some scratchesdont know how inside package product gets scratchesother than that all is okay product is goodand its shock proof for extra safety but no recommended to touch water,value for money,product is good satisfactory, one minor issue the cord is little too hard.,its working as expected. no issues found till now but i have observed the red light is not coming fully. i could see only partial red light is visible. overall best product,nice,this product is very good and easy to use but its plug is of 16 amps which should have been of 6 amps <|>"

earth shaking about this product,it is good,great product.,the product is working nicely and worth buying product.,writing after 1.5 years pros cons solution and trics do read my reviews and vote,works but no use review content here is a try at a review of this product after using it for an year now.use case i am a ncr resident and the air pollution is as we know one of the worst possible if not the worst. i have it installed in the bedroom, about 300 sq ft so well within the advertised max room space. while using the purifier the room is kept closed to minimize pollution addition.build quality the purifier is sturdy in its built and aesthetically pleasing. it has a large front grill that acts as the air inlet, and an arched back that has a larger grill for filtered air outlet. the arc helps the air to be released vertically upwards and hence does not add to direct cooling for anyone sitting in front. this helps the filters use in winter which is the main season where it is required. the top of the filter has a dark panel with touch sensitive buttons and a decent sized circular led screen. the 4 buttons are power, night mode, fan speed, and child lock.setup the air purifier is shipped with its parts packed separately. thus on unboxing the same has to be setup for use. the setup is pretty straightforward. the main filter units front can be released and the individual filters aligned in order on the central space. the installation order of the filter is as followsfirst hepa filter. the same has indication on top to correct installation. you can also go with keeping the phillips branding on the top left cornersecond active carbon filter. the same has indication on top to correct installation. you can also go with keeping the phillips branding on the top left cornerthird pre filter. this one actually clips in place and is used to filter out the larger dust impurities so that it does not clog the other main filters.thus the filtering order is pre filter carbon filter hepa filterworking the air purifier can be set to different modes. one of them being the automatic mode that automates the purifier working thanks to the inbuilt air quality sensor. the pollution level sensed regulates the fan speed accordingly. 4 levels are programmed and are indicated on the small circular led screen by means of circular rings of different colors blue min, violet, pink, red max. red level would put the fan in maximum speed and blue would turn off the filter automatically.if you are not a fan of the automatic mode, you can use the fan speed button to move through the option of different fan speedmodes. they arefan speed 1 indicated by 1 on the screenfan speed 2 indicated by 2 on the screenfan speed 3 indicated by 3 on the screenautomatic mode indicated by a on the screenallergen mode this can be only added on top of automatic mode. it essentially bumps up the speed a bit on all the different color levels. this is to suit the sensitive people as this improves the air filtration rate.turbo mode indicated by t on the screen. this puts the fan in the maximum speed possiblethats pretty much the major functioning of the air purifier. additionally the filter has an automaticforced night mode. the purifier automatically detects the lighting in the room and once it senses low to no light it automatically goes into night mode. the same can be forced by pressing the night mode button the purifier. what this does is that if the filter is in automatic mode, the fan speed is reduced on all the levels so as to minimize the noise.summary so as to summarize my review and add my view here, the filter works pretty well for the use case i have. on regular winter pollution days its able to keep the air quality in control, even when working in automatic mode its able to go down from red levels to blue. switching on an off intermittently as per the air quality levels. on drastic pollution days it has a tough time managing the air quality in automatic mode and i have to force it in turbo mode to get the air quality in control. if not too much of an air change is happening in the room throughout the filter is able to get the air quality to a much acceptable levels.the air quality indicator is a great value add on to the product. much that is missing in similar priced competitors.i am little disappointed in the night mode working as it compensates air quality over noise. i believe the purifiers task is to ensure that the air quality in room is as good as possible. by reducing the fan speed to reduce noise works ok on normal pollution days, but is totally useless in any thing even a little worse when i dont want to use turbo mode just yetdurability of the filters has been decent. i have used it all through the winters last year and intermittently the summer this year but am yet to get an indication to change the hepa or the carbon filter. on yes that reminds me the air purifier would automatically sense and indicate when a filter needs to be replaced by displaying an error code on the screen. it even does that for the prefilter which does not have to be replaced but just cleanedwashed. that i have received 34 times this past year.overall i still strongly recommend this product good performance with a decent price which has been slashed a good amount from when it launched.,good product,the product does not stand out notably, but it probably does the work it is supposed to. it is too late now to return this product and try another make.,over all good product.beasy to install,well designed product. yet, to experience filter replacement and, consequently, the recurring cost.,the product is working nicely and worth buying product.,writing after almost 1.5 years all pros n cons everything is good only problem is i live in delhi and hepa filter will cost you around 2000 and it took only 68 months it become totally black few advice1. dont run it near kitchen it will catch all carbon n pores will b blocked.2. if you live in delhi check it after every month clean with vaccume cleaners.3. seal your doors most dirt mosquito come from there open windows only that too seal them and put anti dust and mosquito net on them.4. run it all day as when u turn it iff after 1 hour your room will be as dirty as ut was.5. you can clean pre filter only dont clean carbon and hepa filter.6. being and indian if your hepa filter become black get some jot water put some detergent and dip it inside all dust and carbon will come out and use it again haha its paper but its so hard you can wash it 45 times keep it under sun light for 45 hours.7. sometimes u get error of fo clean all three filter with vaccume or brush careful while cleaning with brush that dust is dangerous can cause problems so wear mask after cleaning hold ur finger on child lock to reset and it will start working8. bhai delhi m pollution bhot h so family k lie monthly 300rs padta h filter mother wife bachy pura din gher p rhty h so its a must buy to protect them.9. update fan speed got slow down10. power consumption on 1st 23 watt, 2nd 33 watt, 3rd 40 watt, max 50 watt best is keep it on automatic mode when room will be clean power consumption will reduced to 23watt and whole night it work in power efficient mode11. do not left your room door or window open it will continue to be red room should be closed,room is still dusty not much functional <|>"

price,unnecessary buy,delivery without warranty card review content this machine can easily brew coffee for a family of 46 members at a time. some people asked whether this can be used in a cafe. the answer is simple no. reason is that this isnt a sophisticated machine like a professional commercial grade coffee brewer.now my experience with this machine was good. and a bad thing was that i did not get the steam pipe sleeve. except that, everything was well packed. when you buy this machine, make sure to rinse the internal passage. throw the first water from the machine. thoroughly wash the caraffe, puck, filter and measurement spoon. remember to never use dishwash gel or soaps to wash carafe, puck or anything such. it may ruin the coffee aroma.method efficient as per my opinion1. fill the water in tank. no need to measure it as it can be controlled with the selector. dont run it dry. it may damage the heating element or pump.2. switch on the machine. after that, pour the ground coffee powder inside the filter, level it and press it to compress. i use 12 ratio. 1 spoon of coffee powder to 2 spoon of water at output.3. before changing over to drip mode, open the steam valve and check if sufficient pressure is built. placing carafe under the puck, slowly move the selector till europa, and quickly back it to steam icon. this will let the coffee bloom inside. after 57 seconds, slowly move the selector upto espresso. the decoction should be not too slow or not too runny.4. wait till your desired quantity is reached and quickly change the selector to steam mode.5. take milk in a tumbler which is slightly larger than the level of milk. place the tumbler under the steam pipe such a way that the tip should immerse just slight under milk meniscus. slowly open the steam valve located at the side. steam it as per your need.6. mix the milk and decoction. thats itremember to not uncap the top lid after usage as there may still be pressure inside. open the steam valve and let all the pressure get released.coffee used bombay island espresso grind medium roast. use only espresso grind or maybe south indian filter grind. dont use aeropress, v60 or any other grind as it may not produce desired taste.i personally like this machine. for the price its good and build quality is moderate. please watch some youtube videos if you are new to coffee machines. its very very easy to ruin coffee without proper knowledge. you may also watch james hoffmann. he is world barista champion and shares tips about coffee.,im a fan of espresso. every time i go to a coffee joint, i tend to order a doppio a double shot espresso. but, those prices are way too high if i wished to drink a cup of espresso twice everyday. so, ive decided to buy this machine. one thing to say, the quality and durability depends on the user. if you take care, the machine would take care of your cup of joe.so, how do you properly clean this thing is the question raised by many guests after seeing.1. always rinse the drip tray2. use 10 dish washing liquid with 90 water to clean the carafe3. do not hit the filter basket to drop the used grounds. run water over it forcefully to loosen the grounds. this is crucial because dents can affect quality4. before and after your brewing activities, make sure that you clean the internals. to do this, fill the carafe till the 4 mark with bottled water. assemble an empty permafilter. switch on and set the strength to max. in about a minute, you can see steaming hot water flow into the carafe. check its color. if its yellow, then rinse and repeat. if it is white, dry everything and switch it off. then, either do your coffee brewing or assemble it back and call it a day.5. always let the steam out. when you froth milk, immediately wipe off the residual milk with a lint free clothwarning never ever use hardtap water. it causes serious limescaling issues which can greatly affect the taste, quality of your coffee. it may also cause digestive issues. always use softcan waterthe water must not taste salty or sweet. take this seriously. please do not post misleading reviews stating that my machine broke.the steam knob is the worst part of this machine. the machine was used just for 14 days. then, the steam knob decided to loosen up and fall off. i called the service center. they told me to bring it there. the problem is im just 17, and i cant drive. and the service center is far away. so, i removed the rubber casket and fixed the knob directly. it comes off, but i think ill use it only to ease the pressure, because i always drink it black. but this issue makes me reduce a startips for using the machine.1. use fine grounded coffee. i use narasus pb or royal elite bold. currently, im using phalada pure sure organic coffee powder. for the best results, you must grind the coffee on your own. if you cant make sure the coffee is fresh. mind that using instant coffee powder or using coffee mixed with chicory can lead to disaster, both for the machine and your stomach respectively. you can also go for lavazza. but, it makes a hole in your wallet deeper than the mariana trench.2. only use good quality bottledcan water.3. maintain a good cleaning discipline4. in case youve used hardtap water, immediately do a descaling. refer your instruction manual.5. always tamp your ground in the filter. you must apply about 30 pounds of force. this is about 13 kg of force. hold the force for about 6 seconds and slowly rotate the tamper before removing it. make sure the filter lock is up when doing thisas you can see, this is a real espresso maker. it produces crema provided that you use fresh and the correct coffee. for me, it produced about 4 mm crema for a double shot. this is good for a steam driven machine. note that this is a steam driven machine. you can never get the finish of coffee joints, because they use dual boilers powered by thermoblock pumps. although the tastes would be similar, provided you use the correct beans.please look at the pics to see the finish. the cirrus clouds like crema was from coffee powder a week old. the brown and rich crema is from that organic coffee powder ive just bought. can you notice the finish being directly proportional to the freshness this applies even to taste. the white crema cup tasted a bit bitter and left a bittery taste in my mouth. the brown crema cup tasted like coffee at its best, leaving a crisp and nutty taste. also, after i did some research, i came to know that an espresso must have three layers. a bitter crema, a sweet middle and a nutty acidic bottom. you must mix these before drinking to have the best shot. if you see the glass picture ive attached , you can clearly see those layers.overall, this is a great espresso machine for a beginner. it makes great espresso and it is economical too. as i said, if you treat the machine well, the machine would treat your cup of joe well.,being a coffee enthusiast, the product fits in my requirement.easy to use. time taken is reasonable. adjustment of intensity works well.frothing tool is very good... though i prefer black coffee, frothing helps getting a perfect creamy coffee for my guests.,nice product,the coffee strength nob is a mythbut itne paise me itna is good,very happy with the machine, works fine and easy to operate, unfortunately it wasnt packed very well buy the seller so the plastic spoon that came with the machine was broken , everything was packed in the original box with only one tape to secure the box.,it makes the whole process of making coffee more difficult. also was shocked to know this is not covered under amazons return policy. my bad i didnt check and now i am stuck with this. life is no better after you buy this.,coffee maker delivered without warranty card instruction manual <|>"

point,2 in 1 is exactly what i needed read the rest for pros and cons,value for money,apt vacuum cleaner for my requirements, does the job,not so satisfying, if you have other options to not choose it, then go for that other option.,okay okay product,product is very nice and handy but heated after used of 10 minutes. overall performance is good. review content nice product, low noise and good suction power in price range, received damaged packet and without hose pipe, but over all product is good worth of money,received the product on time. have used it once to clean and its easy to use , works well. the heating concern mentioned by prior reviewers is apt however dont a damper for a purchase at this price. its a decent product in the affordable category. the floor attachment particularly works very well. it is light weight and so cleaning lower end of ceiling fans was easy. the suction power when using sofa attachment is quite good in cleaning dust stuck in stitching corners. overall, if you want to spend minimally and get all relevant attachments and your usage is for a 1 bed or a smaller sized apartment, this product is a good start.,,carpet bohot ache se clean nhi kar paata, baaki normal cleaning ache se kar deta he.,got this vacuum cleaner after a lot of research and it has been a good choice till now. i wanted a handheld vacuum cleaner for both car and home cleaning purposes. my primary requirements were cleaning my car and gaming chairssofas. a car vacuum cleaner only wouldnt have suited the purpose. also, i wanted a powerplugged vacuum cleaner as the one with a battery can be used only for a certain amount of time, and there is a long charging period of wait.this product ticks all the requirements. it has a 5m power cable that is long enough to use comfortably. the suction power is good at 16kpa, unlike the 6kpa of most batterypowered cleaners. noise is okay, i mean it isnt so much to disturb someone until and unless someone is really allergic to noise.it has several components that helped clean my car and even my fabric gaming chair. and i was also able to see a visible difference in the window meshes.yes, it gets heated after several minutes of usage, but i could use it with a wait of 23 minutes each time. its weight is ample for horizontal and downwards usage. i havent used the stick provided, and i think it might be a little bit difficult to use it upwards on walls if i need to use it continuously for 10 minutes or more.i had to be sure that the accessories were available after purchase, such as the filter, which i was able to confirm with customer care. its a good buy. lets see in the long run.its made in china. the company provides 6 months of an extended warranty if a review is given and shared with them. this is a bit weird requirement to go ahead with. however, this isnt a sponsored review and is based on hardly a months usage.some photos are attached for help.,nice product, but the filter strain was teared in one place, it needed to repair. but otherwise satisfactory. build quality is very deplorable, they are just forcing the buyers to give 5 star by any means to give better service and warrenty assistance by a card inside the box, this seems really threatening. but overall working of this machine is somehow ok.i would rather suggest if you have options to not choose it, then go for that option.,good for surface cleaning, build quality is not adequate but good to have at this price, <|>"
