The data was collected using a questionnaire divided into three parts. Part one asked respondents to indicate whether stress increased, decreased, or had not changed their work performance in each area, and to indicate the area that was the most and least negatively affected by stress. Part two asked respondents to indicate which programs their companies had implemented to manage stress. Part three collected demographic data for a respondent profile, including full-time employee classification and age group.'"
